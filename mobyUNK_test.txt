" men , " said he , steadily turning upon the crew , as the mate handed 
him the things he had demanded , " my men , the thunder turned old ahab ' s 
needles ; but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own , that 
will point as true as any . " 
UNK glances of UNK wonder were UNK by the sailors , as this 
was said ; and with UNK eyes they UNK whatever magic might 
follow . but starbuck looked away . 
with a blow from the top - maul ahab knocked off the steel head of the 
lance , and then UNK to the mate the long iron rod remaining , bade 
him hold it upright , without its touching the deck . then , with the maul , 
after repeatedly UNK the upper end of this iron rod , he placed the 
UNK needle UNK on the top of it , and less strongly hammered 
that , several times , the mate still holding the rod as before . then 
going through some small strange motions with it - whether indispensable 
to the UNK of the steel , or merely intended to augment the awe 
of the crew , is uncertain - he called for linen UNK ; and moving to the 
binnacle , slipped out the two UNK needles there , and horizontally 
suspended the sail - needle by its middle , over one of the compass - cards . 
at first , the steel went round and round , UNK and vibrating at 
either end ; but at last it settled to its place , when ahab , who had 
been intently watching for this result , stepped frankly back from the 
binnacle , and pointing his stretched arm towards it , exclaimed , - " look 
ye , for yourselves , if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone ! the sun 
is east , and that compass swears it ! " 
one after another they peered in , for nothing but their own eyes could 
persuade such ignorance as theirs , and one after another they UNK 
away . 
in his fiery eyes of scorn and UNK , you then saw ahab in all his 
fatal pride . 
chapter UNK . the log and line . 
while now the UNK pequod had been so long afloat this voyage , the log 
and line had but very seldom been in use . owing to a confident UNK 
upon other means of UNK the vessel ' s place , some merchantmen , 
and many whalemen , especially when cruising , wholly UNK to heave the 
log ; though at the same time , and frequently more for form ' s sake than 
anything else , regularly putting down upon the customary UNK the 
course steered by the ship , as well as the presumed average rate of 
UNK every hour . it had been thus with the pequod . the wooden 
UNK and UNK log attached hung , long UNK , just beneath the 
UNK of the after bulwarks . UNK and spray had UNK it ; sun and 
wind had UNK it ; all the elements had combined to UNK a thing that 
hung so UNK . but UNK of all this , his mood seized ahab , as he 
happened to glance upon the UNK , not many hours after the UNK scene , 
and he remembered how his quadrant was no more , and recalled his frantic 
oath about the level log and line . the ship was sailing UNK ; 
astern the billows rolled in UNK . 
" forward , there ! heave the log ! " 
two seamen came . the golden - UNK UNK and the UNK manxman . " take 
the UNK , one of ye , i ' ll heave . " 
they went towards the extreme stern , on the ship ' s lee side , where the 
deck , with the oblique energy of the wind , was now almost UNK into 
the creamy , sidelong - rushing sea . 
the manxman took the UNK , and holding it high up , by the projecting 
handle - ends of the UNK , round which the UNK of line revolved , so 
stood with the UNK log hanging downwards , till ahab advanced to him . 
ahab stood before him , and was lightly UNK some thirty or forty 
turns to form a preliminary hand - coil to toss overboard , when the old 
manxman , who was intently eyeing both him and the line , made bold to 
speak . 
" sir , i UNK it ; this line looks far gone , long heat and wet have 
spoiled it . " 
" ' UNK hold , old gentleman . long heat and wet , have they spoiled thee ? 
thou seem ' st to hold . or , UNK perhaps , life holds thee ; not thou it . " 
" i hold the UNK , sir . but just as my captain says . with these 
grey hairs of mine ' tis not worth while UNK , ' specially with a 
superior , who ' ll UNK ' er confess . " 
" what ' s that ? there now ' s a patched professor in queen nature ' s 
granite - founded UNK ; but methinks he ' s too UNK . where UNK 
thou born ? " 
" in the little UNK isle of man , sir . " 
" excellent ! thou ' st hit the world by that . " 
" i know not , sir , but i was born there . " 
" in the isle of man , hey ? well , the other way , it ' s good . here ' s a man 
from man ; a man born in once independent man , and now UNK of man ; 
which is sucked in - by what ? up with the UNK ! the dead , blind wall 
butts all inquiring heads at last . up with it ! so . " 
the log was heaved . the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long 
dragging line astern , and then , instantly , the UNK began to UNK . in 
turn , UNK raised and lowered by the rolling billows , the towing 
resistance of the log caused the old UNK to stagger strangely . 
" hold hard ! " 
snap ! the UNK line UNK down in one long UNK ; the UNK 
log was gone . 
" i crush the quadrant , the thunder turns the needles , and now the mad 
sea parts the log - line . but ahab can mend all . haul in here , UNK ; 
UNK up , manxman . and look ye , let the carpenter make another log , and 
mend thou the line . see to it . " 
" there he goes now ; to him nothing ' s happened ; but to me , the skewer 
seems UNK out of the middle of the world . haul in , haul in , 
UNK ! these lines run whole , and whirling out : come in broken , and 
dragging slow . ha , pip ? come to help ; eh , pip ? " 
" pip ? whom call ye pip ? pip jumped from the whale - boat . pip ' s missing . 
let ' s see now if ye haven ' t UNK him up here , fisherman . it drags 
hard ; i guess he ' s holding on . jerk him , tahiti ! jerk him off ; we haul 
in no UNK here . ho ! there ' s his arm just breaking water . a hatchet ! 
a hatchet ! cut it off - we haul in no UNK here . captain ahab ! sir , 
sir ! here ' s pip , trying to get on board again . " 
" peace , thou crazy UNK , " cried the manxman , seizing him by the arm . 
" away from the quarter - deck ! " 
" the greater idiot ever UNK the UNK , " muttered ahab , advancing . 
" hands off from that UNK ! where UNK thou pip was , boy ? 
" astern there , sir , astern ! lo ! lo ! " 
" and who art thou , boy ? i see not my reflection in the vacant UNK of 
thy eyes . oh god ! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to UNK 
through ! who art thou , boy ? " 
" bell - boy , sir ; ship ' s - UNK ; UNK , UNK , UNK ! pip ! pip ! pip ! 
one hundred pounds of clay reward for pip ; five feet high - looks 
UNK - UNK known by that ! UNK , UNK , UNK ! who ' s seen pip the 
coward ? " 
" there can be no hearts above the snow - line . oh , ye frozen heavens ! look 
down here . ye did beget this luckless child , and have abandoned him , 
ye UNK UNK . here , boy ; ahab ' s cabin shall be pip ' s home 
UNK , while ahab lives . thou UNK my UNK centre , boy ; thou 
art tied to me by cords woven of my heart - UNK . come , let ' s down . " 
" what ' s this ? here ' s velvet shark - skin , " intently gazing at ahab ' s hand , 
and feeling it . " ah , now , had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this , 
perhaps he had UNK ' er been lost ! this seems to me , sir , as a man - rope ; 
something that UNK souls may hold by . oh , sir , let old perth now come 
and UNK these two hands together ; the black one with the white , for i 
will not let this go . " 
" oh , boy , nor will i thee , unless i should thereby drag thee to worse 
horrors than are here . come , then , to my cabin . lo ! ye UNK in 
gods all goodness , and in man all ill , lo you ! see the UNK gods 
UNK of suffering man ; and man , though UNK , and knowing not 
what he does , yet full of the sweet things of love and UNK . come ! 
i feel UNK leading thee by thy black hand , than though i grasped an 
emperor ' s ! " 
" there go two UNK ones now , " muttered the old manxman . " one UNK with 
strength , the other UNK with UNK . but here ' s the end of the UNK 
line - all dripping , too . mend it , eh ? i think we had best have a new 
line altogether . i ' ll see mr . stubb about it . " 
chapter UNK . the life - UNK . 
steering now south - eastward by ahab ' s levelled steel , and her progress 
solely determined by ahab ' s level log and line ; the pequod held on 
her path towards the equator . making so long a passage through such 
UNK waters , descrying no ships , and ere long , sideways impelled 
by UNK UNK winds , over waves UNK mild ; all these seemed 
the strange calm things UNK some riotous and desperate scene . 
at last , when the ship drew near to the UNK , as it were , of the 
equatorial UNK - ground , and in the deep darkness that goes before the 
dawn , was sailing by a cluster of UNK UNK ; the watch - then headed 
by flask - was startled by a cry so UNK wild and unearthly - like 
half - UNK UNK of the ghosts of all UNK ' s murdered 
UNK - that one and all , they started from their reveries , and for 
the space of some moments stood , or sat , or leaned all UNK 
listening , like the carved roman slave , while that wild cry remained 
within hearing . the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was 
UNK , and shuddered ; but the pagan harpooneers remained UNK . 
yet the grey manxman - the oldest mariner of all - declared that the wild 
UNK sounds that were heard , were the voices of newly drowned men 
in the sea . 
below in his hammock , ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn , when 
he came to the deck ; it was then UNK to him by flask , not 
UNK with hinted dark meanings . he UNK laughed , and thus 
explained the wonder . 
those UNK islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers 
of seals , and some young seals that had lost their UNK , or some UNK 
that had lost their UNK , must have risen nigh the ship and kept company 
with her , crying and UNK with their human sort of UNK . but this 
only the more affected some of them , because most mariners cherish a 
very superstitious feeling about seals , arising not only from their 
peculiar tones when in distress , but also from the human look of their 
round heads and semi - intelligent faces , seen UNK uprising from 
the water alongside . in the sea , under certain circumstances , seals have 
more than once been mistaken for men . 
but the UNK of the crew were destined to receive a most UNK 
UNK in the fate of one of their number that morning . at 
sun - rise this man went from his hammock to his mast - head at the fore ; 
and whether it was that he was not yet half UNK from his sleep ( for 
sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state ) , whether it was thus 
with the man , there is now no telling ; but , be that as it may , he 
had not been long at his perch , when a cry was heard - a cry and a 
rushing - and looking up , they saw a falling phantom in the air ; and 
looking down , a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the 
sea . 
the life - UNK - a long slender cask - was dropped from the stern , where it 
always hung UNK to a cunning spring ; but no hand rose to seize it , 
and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had UNK , so that it 
slowly filled , and that UNK wood also filled at its every UNK ; and 
the studded iron - bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom , as if to 
yield him his pillow , though in UNK but a hard one . 
and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out 
for the white whale , on the white whale ' s own peculiar ground ; that man 
was swallowed up in the deep . but few , perhaps , thought of that at the 
time . indeed , in some sort , they were not UNK at this event , at 
least as a UNK ; for they regarded it , not as a UNK of evil 
in the future , but as the UNK of an evil already UNK . they 
declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had 
heard the night before . but again the old manxman said nay . 
the lost life - UNK was now to be replaced ; starbuck was directed to see 
to it ; but as no cask of sufficient UNK could be found , and as 
in the UNK eagerness of what seemed the approaching UNK of 
the voyage , all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly 
connected with its final end , whatever that might prove to be ; 
therefore , they were going to leave the ship ' s stern UNK with a 
UNK , when by certain strange signs and UNK queequeg hinted a hint 
concerning his coffin . 
" a life - UNK of a coffin ! " cried starbuck , starting . 
" rather queer , that , i should say , " said stubb . 
" it will make a good enough one , " said flask , " the carpenter here can 
UNK it easily . " 
" bring it up ; there ' s nothing else for it , " said starbuck , after a 
melancholy pause . " rig it , carpenter ; do not look at me so - the coffin , 
i mean . dost thou hear me ? rig it . " 
" and shall i nail down the lid , sir ? " moving his hand as with a hammer . 
" aye . " 
" and shall i UNK the seams , sir ? " moving his hand as with a 
UNK - iron . 
" aye . " 
" and shall i then pay over the same with pitch , sir ? " moving his hand as 
with a pitch - pot . 
" away ! what UNK thee to this ? make a life - UNK of the coffin , and 
no more . - mr . stubb , mr . flask , come forward with me . " 
" he goes off in a UNK . the whole he can endure ; at the parts he UNK . 
now i don ' t like this . i make a leg for captain ahab , and he wears it 
like a gentleman ; but i make a UNK for queequeg , and he won ' t put 
his head into it . are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin ? 
and now i ' m ordered to make a life - UNK of it . it ' s like turning an old 
coat ; going to bring the flesh on the other side now . i don ' t like this 
UNK sort of business - i don ' t like it at all ; it ' s UNK ; 
it ' s not my place . let UNK ' UNK do UNK ; we are their 
UNK . i like to take in hand none but clean , virgin , fair - and - square 
mathematical UNK , something that regularly begins at the beginning , and 
is at the middle when midway , and comes to an end at the conclusion ; not 
a UNK ' s job , that ' s at an end in the middle , and at the beginning at 
the end . it ' s the old woman ' s UNK to be giving UNK UNK . lord ! 
what an affection all old women have for UNK . i know an old woman of 
sixty - five who ran away with a UNK - headed young UNK once . and that ' s 
the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore , when 
i kept my job - shop in the vineyard ; they might have taken it into their 
lonely old heads to run off with me . but UNK - ho ! there are no caps at 
sea but snow - caps . let me see . nail down the lid ; UNK the seams ; pay 
over the same with pitch ; UNK them down tight , and hang it with the 
snap - spring over the ship ' s stern . were ever such things done before 
with a coffin ? some superstitious old carpenters , now , would be tied 
up in the rigging , ere they would do the job . but i ' m made of UNK 
UNK UNK ; i don ' t budge . UNK with a coffin ! sailing 
about with a grave - yard UNK ! but never mind . we UNK in woods make 
bridal - UNK and card - tables , as well as coffins and UNK . we 
work by the month , or by the job , or by the profit ; not for us to ask 
the why and wherefore of our work , unless it be too confounded UNK , 
and then we UNK it if we can . hem ! i ' ll do the job , now , UNK . 
i ' ll have me - let ' s see - how many in the ship ' s company , all told ? but 
i ' ve forgotten . any way , i ' ll have me thirty separate , turk ' s - headed 
life - lines , each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin . then , 
if the hull go down , there ' ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for 
one coffin , a sight not seen very often beneath the sun ! come hammer , 
UNK - iron , pitch - pot , and marling - spike ! let ' s to it . " 
chapter UNK . the deck . 
the coffin laid upon two line - tubs , between the vice - bench and the open 
hatchway ; the carpenter UNK its seams ; the string of twisted oakum 
slowly UNK from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of 
his frock . - ahab comes slowly from the cabin - gangway , and hears pip 
following him . 
" back , lad ; i will be with ye again presently . he goes ! not this hand 
UNK with my humor more UNK than that boy . - middle UNK of a 
church ! what ' s here ? " 
" life - UNK , sir . mr . starbuck ' s orders . oh , look , sir ! beware the 
hatchway ! " 
" thank ye , man . thy coffin lies handy to the UNK . " 
" sir ? the hatchway ? oh ! so it does , sir , so it does . " 
" art not thou the leg - maker ? look , did not this stump come from thy 
shop ? " 
" i believe it did , sir ; does the UNK stand , sir ? " 
" well enough . but art thou not also the UNK ? " 
" aye , sir ; i patched up this thing here as a coffin for queequeg ; but 
they ' ve set me now to turning it into something else . " 
" then tell me ; art thou not an UNK , all - grasping , UNK , 
UNK , heathenish old UNK , to be one day making legs , and the 
next day coffins to clap them in , and yet again life - UNK out of those 
same coffins ? thou art as UNK as the gods , and as much of a 
jack - of - all - trades . " 
" but i do not mean anything , sir . i do as i do . " 
" the gods again . hark ye , dost thou not ever sing working about a 
coffin ? the UNK , they say , UNK snatches when UNK out the 
UNK for UNK ; and the grave - UNK in the play UNK , spade in 
hand . dost thou never ? " 
" sing , sir ? do i sing ? oh , i ' m indifferent enough , sir , for that ; but 
the reason why the grave - UNK made music must have been because there 
was none in his spade , sir . but the UNK UNK is full of it . hark 
to it . " 
" aye , and that ' s because the lid there ' s a sounding - board ; and what in 
all things makes the sounding - board is this - there ' s naught beneath . and 
yet , a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same , carpenter . 
hast thou ever helped carry a UNK , and heard the coffin UNK against 
the churchyard gate , going in ? 
" faith , sir , i ' ve - " 
" faith ? what ' s that ? " 
" why , faith , sir , it ' s only a sort of exclamation - like - that ' s all , 
sir . " 
" um , um ; go on . " 
" i was about to say , sir , that - " 
" art thou a UNK - worm ? dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself ? 
look at thy bosom ! UNK ! and get these UNK out of sight . " 
" he goes aft . that was sudden , now ; but squalls come sudden in hot 
latitudes . i ' ve heard that the isle of UNK , one of the UNK , 
is cut by the equator right in the middle . seems to me some sort of 
equator cuts yon old man , too , right in his middle . he ' s always under 
the line - fiery hot , i tell ye ! he ' s looking this way - come , oakum ; 
quick . here we go again . this wooden UNK is the cork , and i ' m the 
professor of UNK glasses - tap , tap ! " 
( ahab to himself . ) 
" there ' s a sight ! there ' s a sound ! the grey - headed UNK UNK 
the hollow tree ! blind and dumb might well be UNK now . see ! that 
thing UNK on two line - tubs , full of tow - lines . a most malicious UNK , 
that fellow . rat - UNK ! so man ' s UNK UNK ! oh ! how UNK are all 
UNK ! what things real are there , but UNK thoughts ? here 
now ' s the very dreaded symbol of grim death , by a mere UNK , made 
the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life . 
a life - UNK of a coffin ! does it go further ? can it be that in some 
spiritual sense the coffin is , after all , but an UNK - UNK ! 
i ' ll think of that . but no . so far gone am i in the dark side of earth , 
that its other side , the UNK bright one , seems but uncertain 
twilight to me . will ye never have done , carpenter , with that accursed 
sound ? i go below ; let me not see that thing here when i return 
again . now , then , pip , we ' ll talk this over ; i do UNK most wondrous 
UNK from thee ! some unknown UNK from the unknown worlds 
must empty into thee ! " 
chapter UNK . the pequod meets the UNK . 
next day , a large ship , the UNK , was descried , bearing directly down 
upon the pequod , all her spars thickly UNK with men . at the 
time the pequod was making good speed through the water ; but as the 
broad - winged windward stranger shot nigh to her , the UNK sails all 
fell together as blank UNK that are burst , and all life fled from 
the smitten hull . 
" bad news ; she brings bad news , " muttered the old manxman . but ere her 
commander , who , with trumpet to mouth , stood up in his boat ; ere he 
could UNK hail , ahab ' s voice was heard . 
" hast seen the white whale ? " 
" aye , yesterday . have ye seen a whale - boat adrift ? " 
UNK his joy , ahab UNK answered this UNK question ; 
and would then have fain boarded the stranger , when the stranger captain 
himself , having stopped his vessel ' s way , was seen descending her 
side . a few keen UNK , and his boat - hook soon UNK the pequod ' s 
main - chains , and he sprang to the deck . immediately he was recognised by 
ahab for a nantucketer he knew . but no UNK salutation was UNK . 
" where was he ? - not killed ! - not killed ! " cried ahab , closely advancing . 
" how was it ? " 
it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous , while 
three of the stranger ' s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales , which 
had led them some four or five miles from the ship ; and while they were 
yet in swift chase to windward , the white hump and head of moby dick had 
suddenly loomed up out of the water , not very far to leeward ; whereupon , 
the fourth rigged boat - a reserved one - had been instantly lowered in 
chase . after a keen sail before the wind , this fourth boat - the UNK 
UNK of all - seemed to have succeeded in fastening - at least , as 
well as the man at the mast - head could tell anything about it . in the 
distance he saw the diminished dotted boat ; and then a swift UNK 
of bubbling white water ; and after that nothing more ; whence it was 
concluded that the stricken whale must have UNK run away with 
his pursuers , as often happens . there was some apprehension , but no 
positive alarm , as yet . the recall signals were placed in the rigging ; 
darkness came on ; and forced to pick up her three far to windward 
boats - ere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite 
direction - the ship had not only been UNK to leave that boat to 
its fate till near midnight , but , for the time , to UNK her distance 
from it . but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard , she crowded 
all sail - UNK on UNK - after the missing boat ; UNK a fire 
in her try - pots for a UNK ; and every other man aloft on the look - out . 
but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the 
presumed place of the absent ones when last seen ; though she then 
paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her ; and not finding 
anything , had again dashed on ; again paused , and lowered her boats ; and 
though she had thus continued doing till daylight ; yet not the least 
glimpse of the missing keel had been seen . 
the story told , the stranger captain immediately went on to UNK his 
object in boarding the pequod . he desired that ship to unite with his 
own in the search ; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles 
apart , on parallel lines , and so sweeping a double horizon , as it were . 
" i will UNK something now , " whispered stubb to flask , " that some one 
in that missing boat wore off that captain ' s best coat ; mayhap , his 
watch - he ' s so cursed anxious to get it back . who ever heard of two 
pious whale - ships cruising after one missing whale - boat in the height of 
the whaling season ? see , flask , only see how pale he looks - pale in the 
very buttons of his eyes - look - it wasn ' t the coat - it must have been 
the - " 
" my boy , my own boy is among them . for god ' s sake - i beg , i 
UNK " - here exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab , who thus far 
had but UNK received his UNK . " for eight - and - forty hours let me 
UNK your ship - i will gladly pay for it , and UNK pay for it - if 
there be no other way - for eight - and - forty hours only - only that - you 
must , oh , you must , and you shall do this thing . " 
" his son ! " cried stubb , " oh , it ' s his son he ' s lost ! i take back the 
coat and watch - what says ahab ? we must save that boy . " 
" he ' s drowned with the rest on ' em , last night , " said the old manx 
sailor standing behind them ; " i heard ; all of ye heard their spirits . " 
now , as it shortly turned out , what made this incident of the UNK ' s 
the more melancholy , was the circumstance , that not only was one of the 
captain ' s sons among the number of the missing boat ' s crew ; but among 
the number of the other boat ' s crews , at the same time , but on the other 
hand , separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase , 
there had been still another son ; as that for a time , the wretched 
father was plunged to the bottom of the UNK perplexity ; which 
was only UNK for him by his chief mate ' s instinctively UNK the 
ordinary procedure of a whale - ship in such UNK , that is , when 
placed between UNK but divided boats , always to pick up the 
majority first . but the captain , for some unknown UNK reason , 
had UNK from mentioning all this , and not till forced to it by 
ahab ' s UNK did he UNK to his one yet missing boy ; a little lad , 
but twelve years old , whose father with the earnest but UNK 
UNK of a nantucketer ' s UNK love , had thus early sought to 
UNK him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost UNK 
the UNK of all his race . nor does it UNK occur , that 
nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them , 
for a UNK three or four years ' voyage in some other ship than 
their own ; so that their first knowledge of a whaleman ' s career shall 
be UNK by any chance UNK of a father ' s natural but UNK 
UNK , or UNK apprehensiveness and concern . 
meantime , now the stranger was still UNK his poor UNK of ahab ; 
and ahab still stood like an anvil , receiving every shock , but without 
the least UNK of his own . 
" i will not go , " said the stranger , " till you say aye to me . do to me 
as you would have me do to you in the like case . for you too have a boy , 
captain ahab - though but a child , and UNK safely at home now - a 
child of your old age too - yes , yes , you UNK ; i see it - run , run , 
men , now , and stand by to square in the yards . " 
" avast , " cried ahab - " touch not a rope - yarn " ; then in a voice that 
UNK UNK every word - " captain UNK , i will not do it . 
even now i lose time . good - bye , good - bye . god bless ye , man , and may i 
UNK myself , but i must go . mr . starbuck , look at the binnacle watch , 
and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers : 
then brace forward again , and let the ship sail as before . " 
hurriedly turning , with UNK face , he descended into his cabin , 
leaving the strange captain UNK at this unconditional and utter 
UNK of his so earnest suit . but starting from his UNK , 
UNK silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his 
boat , and returned to his ship . 
soon the two ships UNK their wakes ; and long as the strange vessel 
was in view , she was seen to UNK hither and thither at every dark spot , 
however small , on the sea . this way and that her yards were swung round ; 
starboard and larboard , she continued to UNK ; now she beat against a 
head sea ; and again it pushed her before it ; while all the while , her 
masts and yards were thickly UNK with men , as three tall UNK 
trees , when the boys are UNK among the boughs . 
but by her still UNK course and winding , UNK way , you plainly saw 
that this ship that so UNK with spray , still remained without comfort . 
she was UNK , weeping for her children , because they were not . 
chapter UNK . the cabin . 
( ahab moving to go on deck ; pip UNK him by the hand to follow . ) 
" lad , lad , i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now . the hour is coming 
when ahab would not UNK thee from him , yet would not have thee by him . 
there is that in thee , poor lad , which i feel too UNK to my UNK . 
like UNK like ; and for this hunt , my UNK becomes my most desired 
health . do thou UNK below here , where they shall serve thee , as if 
thou UNK the captain . aye , lad , thou shalt sit here in my own screwed 
chair ; another screw to it , thou must be . " 
" no , no , no ! ye have not a whole body , sir ; do ye but use poor me for 
your one lost leg ; only tread upon me , sir ; i ask no more , so i remain a 
part of ye . " 
" oh ! spite of UNK villains , this makes me a UNK in the UNK 
UNK of man ! - and a black ! and crazy ! - but methinks like - UNK - like 
applies to him too ; he UNK so UNK again . " 
" they tell me , sir , that stubb did once desert poor little pip , whose 
drowned bones now show white , for all the blackness of his living skin . 
but i will never desert ye , sir , as stubb did him . sir , i must go with 
ye . " 
" if thou UNK thus to me much more , ahab ' s purpose keels up in him . 
i tell thee no ; it cannot be . " 
" oh good master , master , master ! 
" UNK so , and i will murder thee ! have a care , for ahab too is mad . 
listen , and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck , and still 
know that i am there . and now i quit thee . thy hand ! - met ! true art 
thou , lad , as the circumference to its centre . so : god for ever bless 
thee ; and if it come to that , - god for ever save thee , let what will 
UNK . " 
( ahab goes ; pip steps one step forward . ) 
" here he this instant stood ; i stand in his air , - but i ' m alone . now 
were even poor pip here i could endure it , but he ' s missing . pip ! pip ! 
UNK , UNK , UNK ! who ' s seen pip ? he must be up here ; let ' s try the 
door . what ? neither lock , nor bolt , nor bar ; and yet there ' s no opening 
it . it must be the spell ; he told me to stay here : aye , and told me this 
screwed chair was mine . here , then , i ' ll seat me , against the transom , 
in the ship ' s full middle , all her keel and her three masts before me . 
here , our old sailors say , in their black seventy - UNK great 
admirals sometimes sit at table , and lord it over rows of captains and 
UNK . ha ! what ' s this ? UNK ! UNK ! the UNK all come 
crowding ! pass round the UNK ; glad to see ye ; fill up , UNK ! 
what an odd feeling , now , when a black boy ' s host to white men with gold 
UNK upon their coats ! - UNK , have ye seen one pip ? - a little 
negro lad , five feet high , hang - dog look , and UNK ! jumped from a 
whale - boat once ; - seen him ? no ! well then , fill up again , captains , and 
let ' s drink shame upon all UNK ! i name no names . shame upon them ! 
put one foot upon the table . shame upon all UNK . - hist ! above there , 
i hear ivory - oh , master ! master ! i am indeed down - hearted when you walk 
over me . but here i ' ll stay , though this stern strikes rocks ; and they 
UNK through ; and UNK come to join me . " 
chapter UNK . the hat . 
and now that at the proper time and place , after so long and wide a 
preliminary cruise , ahab , - all other whaling waters swept - seemed to 
have chased his foe into an ocean - fold , to UNK him the more securely 
there ; now , that he found himself hard by the very latitude and 
longitude where his UNK wound had been inflicted ; now that a 
vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually 
encountered moby dick ; - and now that all his successive meetings with 
various ships UNK UNK to show the demoniac indifference 
with which the white whale tore his hunters , whether UNK or UNK 
against ; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man ' s eyes , 
which it was hardly sufferable for UNK souls to see . as the UNK 
polar star , which through the UNK , arctic , six months ' night 
UNK its piercing , steady , central gaze ; so ahab ' s purpose now 
UNK gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew . it 
UNK above them so , that all their UNK , doubts , misgivings , 
fears , were fain to hide beneath their souls , and not UNK forth a 
single spear or UNK . 
in this UNK interval too , all humor , forced or natural , 
UNK . stubb no more UNK to raise a smile ; starbuck no more UNK 
to UNK one . alike , joy and sorrow , hope and fear , seemed ground to 
finest dust , and UNK , for the time , in the UNK mortar of 
ahab ' s iron soul . like UNK , they UNK moved about the deck , ever 
conscious that the old man ' s UNK eye was on them . 
but did you deeply UNK him in his more secret confidential hours ; when 
he thought no glance but one was on him ; then you would have seen that 
even as ahab ' s eyes so UNK the crew ' s , the inscrutable parsee ' s glance 
UNK his ; or somehow , at least , in some wild way , at times affected it . 
such an added , gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah 
now ; such ceaseless UNK shook him ; that the men looked dubious 
at him ; half uncertain , as it seemed , whether indeed he were a mortal 
substance , or else a UNK shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen 
being ' s body . and that shadow was always hovering there . for not by 
night , even , had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber , or go 
below . he would stand still for hours : but never sat or leaned ; his UNK 
but wondrous eyes did plainly say - we two UNK never rest . 
nor , at any time , by night or day could the mariners now step upon the 
deck , unless ahab was before them ; either standing in his pivot - hole , or 
exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating UNK , - the main - mast 
and the UNK ; or else they saw him standing in the cabin - scuttle , - his 
living foot advanced upon the deck , as if to step ; his hat slouched 
heavily over his eyes ; so that however motionless he stood , however the 
days and nights were added on , that he had not swung in his hammock ; 
yet hidden beneath that UNK hat , they could never tell unerringly 
whether , for all this , his eyes were really closed at times ; or whether 
he was still intently UNK them ; no matter , though he stood so in 
the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch , and the unheeded night - damp 
gathered in UNK of UNK upon that stone - carved coat and hat . the 
clothes that the night had wet , the next day ' s UNK dried upon him ; 
and so , day after day , and night after night ; he went no more beneath 
the planks ; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for . 
he ate in the same open air ; that is , his two only meals , - breakfast and 
dinner : supper he never touched ; nor reaped his beard ; which darkly grew 
all UNK , as UNK UNK of trees blown over , which still grow 
UNK on at naked base , though perished in the upper verdure . but though 
his whole life was now become one watch on deck ; and though the parsee ' s 
mystic watch was without UNK as his own ; yet these two never 
seemed to speak - one man to the other - unless at long intervals some 
passing UNK matter made it necessary . though such a potent spell 
seemed UNK to join the twain ; openly , and to the awe - struck crew , 
they seemed pole - like UNK . if by day they chanced to speak one word ; 
by night , dumb men were both , so far as concerned the slightest UNK 
interchange . at times , for UNK hours , without a single hail , they 
stood far parted in the UNK ; ahab in his scuttle , the parsee by 
the mainmast ; but still UNK gazing upon each other ; as if in the 
parsee ahab saw his UNK shadow , in ahab the parsee his abandoned 
substance . 
and yet , somehow , did ahab - in his own proper self , as daily , UNK , 
and every instant , UNK revealed to his UNK , - ahab 
seemed an independent lord ; the parsee but his slave . still again both 
seemed yoked together , and an unseen UNK driving them ; the lean shade 
UNK the solid rib . for be this parsee what he may , all rib and keel 
was solid ahab . 
at the first UNK UNK of the dawn , his iron voice was heard 
from aft , - " man the mast - heads ! " - and all through the day , till after 
sunset and after twilight , the same voice every hour , at the striking of 
the helmsman ' s bell , was heard - " what d ' ye see ? - sharp ! sharp ! " 
but when three or four days had UNK by , after meeting the 
children - seeking UNK ; and no spout had yet been seen ; the monomaniac 
old man seemed distrustful of his crew ' s UNK ; at least , of nearly 
all except the pagan harpooneers ; he seemed to doubt , even , whether 
stubb and flask might not willingly UNK the sight he sought . but if 
these suspicions were really his , he UNK UNK from verbally 
UNK them , however his UNK might seem to hint them . 
" i will have the first sight of the whale myself , " - he said . " aye ! 
ahab must have the doubloon ! " and with his own hands he rigged a nest 
of UNK UNK ; and sending a hand aloft , with a single UNK 
block , to secure to the main - mast head , he received the two ends of the 
downward - UNK rope ; and UNK one to his basket prepared a pin for 
the other end , in order to fasten it at the rail . this done , with that 
end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin , he looked round upon 
his crew , sweeping from one to the other ; pausing his glance long upon 
daggoo , queequeg , tashtego ; but UNK fedallah ; and then UNK his 
firm UNK eye upon the chief mate , said , - " take the rope , sir - i give 
it into thy hands , starbuck . " then UNK his person in the basket , 
he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch , starbuck being 
the one who secured the rope at last ; and afterwards stood near it . and 
thus , with one hand clinging round the royal mast , ahab gazed abroad 
upon the sea for miles and miles , - ahead , astern , this side , and 
that , - within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height . 
when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in 
the rigging , which chances to afford no UNK , the sailor at sea is 
hoisted up to that spot , and UNK there by the rope ; under these 
circumstances , its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge 
to some one man who has the special watch of it . because in such a 
wilderness of running rigging , whose various different UNK aloft 
cannot always be infallibly UNK by what is seen of them at the 
deck ; and when the deck - ends of these ropes are being every few minutes 
cast down from the UNK , it would be but a natural fatality , if , 
UNK with a constant UNK , the hoisted sailor should by some 
UNK of the crew be cast adrift and fall all UNK to the 
sea . so ahab ' s proceedings in this matter were not unusual ; the only 
strange thing about them seemed to be , that starbuck , almost the one 
only man who had ever UNK to UNK him with anything in the 
slightest degree approaching to UNK - one of those too , whose 
UNK on the look - out he had seemed to doubt somewhat ; - it was 
strange , that this was the very man he should UNK for his UNK ; 
freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person ' s 
hands . 
now , the first time ahab was perched aloft ; ere he had been there ten 
minutes ; one of those red - UNK savage sea - UNK which so often fly 
UNK close round the manned mast - heads of whalemen in these 
latitudes ; one of these birds came UNK and screaming round his head 
in a UNK of UNK swift UNK . then it darted a thousand feet 
straight up into the air ; then UNK downwards , and went eddying 
again round his head . 
but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon , ahab seemed 
not to mark this wild bird ; nor , indeed , would any one else have marked 
it much , it being no uncommon circumstance ; only now almost the least 
heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every 
sight . 
" your hat , your hat , sir ! " suddenly cried the sicilian seaman , who 
being posted at the UNK - mast - head , stood directly behind ahab , though 
somewhat lower than his level , and with a deep gulf of air dividing 
them . 
but already the sable wing was before the old man ' s eyes ; the long 
hooked bill at his head : with a UNK , the black UNK darted away with 
his prize . 
an eagle flew thrice round UNK ' s head , removing his cap to UNK 
it , and UNK UNK , his wife , declared that UNK would 
be king of rome . but only by the replacing of the cap was that UNK 
accounted good . ahab ' s hat was never UNK ; the wild UNK flew on and 
on with it ; far in advance of the prow : and at last disappeared ; while 
from the point of that UNK , a minute black spot was dimly 
UNK , falling from that vast height into the sea . 
chapter UNK . the pequod meets the delight . 
the intense pequod sailed on ; the rolling waves and days went by ; the 
life - UNK - coffin still lightly swung ; and another ship , most miserably 
UNK the delight , was descried . as she drew nigh , all eyes were 
fixed upon her broad beams , called UNK , which , in some whaling - ships , 
cross the quarter - deck at the height of eight or nine feet ; UNK to 
carry the spare , UNK , or UNK boats . 
upon the stranger ' s UNK were beheld the shattered , white ribs , and 
some few splintered planks , of what had once been a whale - boat ; but you 
now saw through this wreck , as plainly as you see through the peeled , 
half - unhinged , and UNK skeleton of a horse . 
" hast seen the white whale ? " 
" look ! " replied the hollow - UNK captain from his taffrail ; and with 
his trumpet he pointed to the wreck . 
" hast killed him ? " 
" the harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that , " answered the 
other , sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck , whose gathered 
sides some noiseless sailors were busy in UNK together . 
" not forged ! " and snatching perth ' s levelled iron from the crotch , ahab 
held it out , UNK - " look ye , nantucketer ; here in this hand i hold 
his death ! tempered in blood , and tempered by lightning are these barbs ; 
and i swear to temper them UNK in that hot place behind the fin , 
where the white whale most feels his accursed life ! " 
" then god keep thee , old man - see ' st thou that " - pointing to the 
hammock - " i bury but one of five stout men , who were alive only 
yesterday ; but were dead ere night . only that one i bury ; the rest were 
buried before they died ; you sail upon their tomb . " then turning to his 
crew - " are ye ready there ? place the plank then on the rail , and 
lift the body ; so , then - oh ! god " - advancing towards the hammock with 
uplifted hands - " may the resurrection and the life - " 
" brace forward ! up helm ! " cried ahab like lightning to his men . 
but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound 
of the UNK that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea ; not so 
quick , indeed , but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled 
her hull with their ghostly UNK . 
as ahab now glided from the UNK delight , the strange life - UNK 
hanging at the pequod ' s stern came into conspicuous relief . 
" ha ! yonder ! look yonder , men ! " cried a foreboding voice in her wake . 
" in vain , oh , ye strangers , ye fly our sad burial ; ye but turn us your 
taffrail to show us your coffin ! " 
chapter UNK . the UNK . 
it was a clear steel - blue day . the UNK of air and sea were 
hardly UNK in that all - pervading azure ; only , the UNK air was 
UNK pure and soft , with a woman ' s look , and the robust and 
man - like sea heaved with long , strong , lingering swells , as UNK ' s 
chest in his sleep . 
hither , and thither , on high , glided the snow - white wings of small , 
UNK birds ; these were the gentle thoughts of the UNK air ; 
but to and fro in the deeps , far down in the bottomless blue , rushed 
mighty leviathans , sword - fish , and sharks ; and these were the strong , 
troubled , murderous UNK of the UNK sea . 
but though thus contrasting within , the contrast was only in shades and 
shadows without ; those two seemed one ; it was only the UNK , as it were , 
that distinguished them . 
aloft , like a royal czar and king , the sun seemed giving this gentle 
air to this bold and rolling sea ; even as UNK to UNK . and at the 
UNK line of the horizon , a soft and UNK motion - most seen 
here at the equator - denoted the fond , throbbing UNK , the loving 
UNK , with which the poor UNK gave her bosom away . 
tied up and twisted ; UNK and knotted with wrinkles ; UNK firm 
and UNK ; his eyes glowing like coals , that still glow in the 
ashes of ruin ; UNK ahab stood forth in the UNK of the 
UNK ; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl ' s 
forehead of heaven . 
oh , immortal infancy , and UNK of the azure ! invisible winged 
creatures that UNK all round us ! sweet UNK of air and sky ! how 
UNK were ye of old ahab ' s close - coiled woe ! but so have i seen 
little UNK and martha , laughing - eyed UNK , UNK UNK around 
their old sire ; UNK with the circle of UNK locks which grew on 
the UNK of that burnt - out crater of his brain . 
slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle , ahab leaned over the side and 
watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze , the more 
and the more that he UNK to UNK the UNK . but the lovely 
UNK in that enchanted air did at last seem to UNK , for a moment , 
the UNK thing in his soul . that glad , happy air , that UNK 
sky , did at last stroke and UNK him ; the step - mother world , so long 
cruel - UNK - now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck , 
and did seem to UNK sob over him , as if over one , that however 
wilful and UNK , she could yet find it in her heart to save and to 
bless . from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea ; 
nor did all the pacific contain such UNK as that one UNK drop . 
starbuck saw the old man ; saw him , how he heavily leaned over the side ; 
and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless UNK that 
stole out of the centre of the serenity around . careful not to touch 
him , or be noticed by him , he yet drew near to him , and stood there . 
ahab turned . 
" starbuck ! " 
" sir . " 
" oh , starbuck ! it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky . on such 
a day - very much such a UNK as this - i struck my first whale - a 
boy - harpooneer of eighteen ! forty - forty - forty years ago ! - ago ! forty 
years of continual whaling ! forty years of UNK , and peril , and 
storm - time ! forty years on the UNK sea ! for forty years has ahab 
UNK the peaceful land , for forty years to make war on the horrors 
of the deep ! aye and yes , starbuck , out of those forty years i have not 
spent three ashore . when i think of this life i have led ; the desolation 
of UNK it has been ; the masoned , walled - town of a captain ' s 
UNK , which admits but small entrance to any UNK from the 
green country without - oh , weariness ! UNK ! guinea - coast UNK of 
solitary command ! - when i think of all this ; only half - suspected , not so 
UNK known to me before - and how for forty years i have fed upon dry 
salted fare - fit UNK of the dry UNK of my soil ! - when the 
UNK landsman has had fresh UNK to his daily hand , and broken the 
world ' s fresh bread to my mouldy UNK - away , whole oceans away , from 
that young girl - wife i wedded past fifty , and sailed for cape horn 
the next day , leaving but one dent in my UNK pillow - wife ? 
wife ? - rather a widow with her UNK alive ! aye , i UNK that poor 
girl when i UNK her , starbuck ; and then , the madness , the UNK , 
the boiling blood and the smoking brow , with which , for a thousand 
UNK old ahab has furiously , UNK chased his prey - more a 
UNK than a man ! - aye , aye ! what a forty years ' fool - fool - old fool , 
has old ahab been ! why this UNK of the chase ? why weary , and UNK 
the arm at the oar , and the iron , and the lance ? how the UNK or 
better is ahab now ? behold . oh , starbuck ! is it not hard , that with this 
weary load i bear , one poor leg should have been snatched from under 
me ? here , UNK this old hair aside ; it blinds me , that i seem to UNK . 
locks so grey did never grow but from out some ashes ! but do i look 
very old , so very , very old , starbuck ? i feel deadly faint , bowed , and 
humped , as though i were adam , UNK beneath the piled 
centuries since paradise . god ! god ! god ! - crack my heart ! - stave my 
brain ! - UNK ! UNK ! bitter , biting UNK of grey hairs , have 
i lived enough joy to wear ye ; and seem and feel thus intolerably old ? 
close ! stand close to me , starbuck ; let me look into a human eye ; it is 
better than to gaze into sea or sky ; better than to gaze upon god . by 
the green land ; by the bright hearth - stone ! this is the magic glass , 
man ; i see my wife and my child in thine eye . no , no ; stay on board , on 
board ! - lower not when i do ; when branded ahab gives chase to moby dick . 
that hazard shall not be thine . no , no ! not with the far away home i see 
in that eye ! " 
" oh , my captain ! my captain ! noble soul ! grand old heart , after all ! why 
should any one give chase to that hated fish ! away with me ! let us 
fly these deadly waters ! let us home ! wife and child , too , are 
starbuck ' s - wife and child of his UNK , UNK , play - fellow 
youth ; even as thine , sir , are the wife and child of thy loving , 
longing , UNK old age ! away ! let us away ! - this instant let me UNK 
the course ! how cheerily , how UNK , o my captain , would we bowl 
on our way to see old nantucket again ! i think , sir , they have some such 
mild blue days , even as this , in nantucket . " 
" they have , they have . i have seen them - some summer days in the 
morning . about this time - yes , it is his noon nap now - the boy 
UNK wakes ; sits up in bed ; and his mother tells him of me , of 
cannibal old me ; how i am abroad upon the deep , but will yet come back 
to dance him again . " 
" ' tis my mary , my mary herself ! she UNK that my boy , every morning , 
should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his father ' s 
sail ! yes , yes ! no more ! it is done ! we head for nantucket ! come , my 
captain , study out the course , and let us away ! see , see ! the boy ' s face 
from the window ! the boy ' s hand on the hill ! " 
but ahab ' s glance was UNK ; like a UNK UNK tree he shook , and 
cast his last , UNK apple to the soil . 
" what is it , what nameless , inscrutable , unearthly thing is it ; what 
UNK , hidden lord and master , and cruel , remorseless emperor 
UNK me ; that against all natural UNK and UNK , i so keep 
pushing , and crowding , and jamming myself on all the time ; recklessly 
making me ready to do what in my own proper , natural heart , i durst not 
so much as dare ? is ahab , ahab ? is it i , god , or who , that UNK this 
arm ? but if the great sun move not of himself ; but is as an errand - boy 
in heaven ; nor one single star can revolve , but by some invisible power ; 
how then can this one small heart beat ; this one small brain think 
thoughts ; unless god does that beating , does that thinking , does that 
living , and not i . by heaven , man , we are turned round and round in 
this world , like yonder windlass , and fate is the UNK . and all 
the time , lo ! that UNK sky , and this unsounded sea ! look ! see yon 
UNK ! who put it into him to chase and UNK that flying - fish ? where 
do murderers go , man ! who ' s to doom , when the judge himself is dragged 
to the bar ? but it is a mild , mild wind , and a mild looking sky ; and 
the air smells now , as if it blew from a far - away meadow ; they have been 
making hay somewhere under the UNK of the andes , starbuck , and the 
mowers are sleeping among the new - UNK hay . sleeping ? aye , toil we how 
we may , we all sleep at last on the field . sleep ? aye , and rust amid 
greenness ; as last year ' s scythes flung down , and left in the half - cut 
UNK - starbuck ! " 
but UNK to a corpse ' s hue with despair , the mate had stolen away . 
ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side ; but started at 
two UNK , fixed eyes in the water there . fedallah was UNK 
leaning over the same rail . 
chapter UNK . the chase - first day . 
that night , in the mid - watch , when the old man - as his wont at 
intervals - stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned , and went 
to his pivot - hole , he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely , snuffing 
up the sea air as a sagacious ship ' s dog will , in drawing nigh to 
some UNK isle . he declared that a whale must be near . soon that 
peculiar odor , sometimes to a great distance given forth by the 
living sperm whale , was palpable to all the watch ; nor was any mariner 
surprised when , after UNK the compass , and then the dog - UNK , and 
then UNK the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible , 
ahab rapidly ordered the ship ' s course to be slightly UNK , and the 
sail to be UNK . 
the UNK policy UNK these movements was sufficiently UNK 
at UNK , by the sight of a long UNK on the sea directly and 
lengthwise ahead , smooth as oil , and resembling in the UNK watery 
wrinkles UNK it , the polished UNK - like marks of some swift 
tide - UNK , at the mouth of a deep , rapid stream . 
" man the mast - heads ! call all hands ! " 
UNK with the butts of three UNK handspikes on the forecastle 
deck , daggoo UNK the sleepers with such judgment claps that they 
seemed to UNK from the scuttle , so UNK did they appear 
with their clothes in their hands . 
" what d ' ye see ? " cried ahab , UNK his face to the sky . 
" nothing , nothing sir ! " was the sound hailing down in reply . 
" t ' gallant sails ! - UNK ! UNK and aloft , and on both sides ! " 
all sail being set , he now cast loose the life - line , reserved for 
swaying him to the main royal - mast head ; and in a few moments they were 
hoisting him thither , when , while but two thirds of the way aloft , 
and while peering ahead through the horizontal UNK between the 
main - top - sail and top - gallant - sail , he raised a gull - like cry in the 
air . " there she blows ! - there she blows ! a hump like a snow - hill ! it is 
moby dick ! " 
UNK by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three 
look - outs , the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous 
whale they had so long been pursuing . ahab had now gained his final 
perch , some feet above the other look - outs , tashtego standing just 
beneath him on the cap of the top - gallant - mast , so that the indian ' s 
head was almost on a level with ahab ' s heel . from this height the whale 
was now seen some mile or so ahead , at every roll of the sea revealing 
his high sparkling hump , and regularly UNK his silent spout into the 
air . to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had 
so long ago beheld in the UNK atlantic and indian oceans . 
" and did none of ye see it before ? " cried ahab , hailing the perched men 
all around him . 
" i saw him almost that same instant , sir , that captain ahab did , and i 
cried out , " said tashtego . 
" not the same instant ; not the same - no , the doubloon is mine , fate 
reserved the doubloon for me . i only ; none of ye could have raised the 
white whale first . there she blows ! - there she blows ! - there she blows ! 
there again ! - there again ! " he cried , in long - drawn , lingering , UNK 
tones , UNK to the UNK UNK of the whale ' s visible jets . 
" he ' s going to sound ! in UNK ! down top - gallant - sails ! stand by 
three boats . mr . starbuck , remember , stay on board , and keep the ship . 
helm there ! UNK , UNK a point ! so ; steady , man , steady ! there go 
flukes ! no , no ; only black water ! all ready the boats there ? stand by , 
stand by ! lower me , mr . starbuck ; lower , lower , - quick , UNK ! " and he 
slid through the air to the deck . 
" he is heading straight to leeward , sir , " cried stubb , " right away from 
us ; cannot have seen the ship yet . " 
" be dumb , man ! stand by the braces ! hard down the helm ! - brace up ! 
shiver her ! - shiver her ! - so ; well that ! boats , boats ! " 
soon all the boats but starbuck ' s were dropped ; all the boat - sails 
set - all the paddles UNK ; with UNK UNK , shooting to 
leeward ; and ahab heading the onset . a pale , death - UNK lit up 
fedallah ' s sunken eyes ; a hideous motion UNK his mouth . 
like noiseless UNK shells , their light UNK UNK through the sea ; 
but only slowly they neared the foe . as they neared him , the ocean grew 
still more smooth ; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves ; seemed a 
noon - meadow , so serenely it spread . at length the UNK hunter came 
so nigh his seemingly UNK prey , that his entire UNK hump 
was distinctly visible , sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing , 
and continually set in a revolving ring of finest , UNK , UNK 
foam . he saw the vast , involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head 
beyond . before it , far out on the soft turkish - UNK waters , went 
the glistening white shadow from his broad , milky forehead , a UNK 
UNK UNK accompanying the shade ; and behind , the blue waters 
UNK flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake ; 
and on either hand bright bubbles arose and UNK by his side . but 
these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly 
UNK the sea , UNK with their UNK flight ; and like to 
some flag - staff rising from the painted hull of an UNK , the tall but 
shattered pole of a UNK lance projected from the white whale ' s back ; 
and at intervals one of the cloud of soft - UNK fowls hovering , and 
to and fro UNK like a UNK over the fish , silently perched and 
rocked on this pole , the long tail feathers UNK like UNK . 
a gentle UNK - a mighty mildness of repose in UNK , invested 
the gliding whale . not the white bull jupiter swimming away with 
UNK UNK clinging to his graceful horns ; his lovely , UNK 
eyes sideways intent upon the maid ; with smooth UNK fleetness , 
UNK straight for the UNK bower in UNK ; not jove , not that 
great majesty supreme ! did UNK the UNK white whale as he so 
UNK swam . 
on each soft side - UNK with the parted swell , that but once 
leaving him , then flowed so wide away - on each bright side , the whale 
shed off UNK . no wonder there had been some among the hunters who 
UNK transported and allured by all this serenity , had UNK 
to UNK it ; but had UNK found that quietude but the vesture of 
tornadoes . yet calm , UNK calm , oh , whale ! thou UNK on , to all 
who for the first time eye thee , no matter how many in that same way 
thou may ' st have UNK and destroyed before . 
and thus , through the serene UNK of the tropical sea , among 
waves whose hand - UNK were suspended by exceeding UNK , moby 
dick moved on , still UNK from sight the full terrors of his 
submerged trunk , entirely hiding the wrenched UNK of his jaw . 
but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water ; for an instant 
his whole UNK body formed a high arch , like virginia ' s natural 
UNK , and UNK waving his UNK flukes in the air , the 
grand god revealed himself , sounded , and went out of sight . UNK 
UNK , and UNK on the wing , the white sea - fowls UNK lingered 
over the agitated UNK that he left . 
with oars UNK , and paddles down , the sheets of their sails adrift , the 
three boats now UNK floated , awaiting moby dick ' s UNK . 
" an hour , " said ahab , standing rooted in his boat ' s stern ; and he gazed 
beyond the whale ' s place , towards the dim blue spaces and wide UNK 
UNK to leeward . it was only an instant ; for again his eyes seemed 
whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle . the breeze now 
UNK ; the sea began to swell . 
" the birds ! - the birds ! " cried tashtego . 
in long indian file , as when UNK take wing , the white birds were 
now all flying towards ahab ' s boat ; and when within a few yards began 
UNK over the water there , UNK round and round , with UNK , 
UNK cries . their vision was UNK than man ' s ; ahab could discover 
no sign in the sea . but suddenly as he peered down and down into its 
depths , he profoundly saw a white living spot no UNK than a white 
UNK , with wonderful celerity uprising , and magnifying as it rose , 
till it turned , and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked 
rows of white , glistening teeth , floating up from the UNK 
bottom . it was moby dick ' s open mouth and UNK jaw ; his vast , 
UNK bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea . the 
glittering mouth UNK beneath the boat like an open - UNK marble 
tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , ahab whirled 
the craft aside from this tremendous apparition . then , calling upon 
fedallah to change places with him , went forward to the bows , and 
seizing perth ' s harpoon , commanded his crew to grasp their oars and 
stand by to stern . 
now , by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis , its 
bow , by UNK , was made to face the whale ' s head while yet 
under water . but as if UNK this UNK , moby dick , with that 
malicious intelligence ascribed to him , UNK UNK himself , 
as it were , in an instant , shooting his UNK head lengthwise beneath 
the boat . 
through and through ; through every plank and each rib , it UNK for 
an instant , the whale obliquely lying on his back , in the manner of 
a biting shark , slowly and UNK taking its bows full within his 
mouth , so that the long , narrow , UNK lower jaw curled high up into 
the open air , and one of the teeth caught in a row - lock . the UNK 
pearl - white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahab ' s 
head , and reached higher than that . in this attitude the white whale 
now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel UNK her mouse . with 
UNK eyes fedallah gazed , and crossed his arms ; but the 
tiger - yellow crew were tumbling over each other ' s heads to gain the 
uttermost stern . 
and now , while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out , as the 
whale UNK with the doomed craft in this devilish way ; and from his 
body being submerged beneath the boat , he could not be darted at from 
the bows , for the bows were almost inside of him , as it were ; and 
while the other boats involuntarily paused , as before a quick UNK 
impossible to withstand , then it was that monomaniac ahab , furious with 
this UNK vicinity of his foe , which placed him all alive and 
UNK in the very jaws he hated ; UNK with all this , he seized 
the long bone with his naked hands , and wildly UNK to UNK it from 
its UNK . as now he thus vainly UNK , the jaw slipped from him ; the 
UNK gunwales bent in , collapsed , and snapped , as both jaws , like an 
enormous UNK , sliding further aft , bit the craft completely in twain , 
and locked themselves fast again in the sea , midway between the two 
floating wrecks . these floated aside , the broken ends drooping , the crew 
at the stern - wreck clinging to the gunwales , and striving to hold fast 
to the oars to lash them across . 
at that UNK moment , ere the boat was yet snapped , ahab , the first 
to perceive the whale ' s intent , by the UNK UNK of his head , a 
movement that UNK his hold for the time ; at that moment his hand 
had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite . but only 
slipping further into the whale ' s mouth , and UNK over sideways as it 
slipped , the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw ; spilled him out of 
it , as he leaned to the push ; and so he fell flat - faced upon the sea . 
UNK withdrawing from his prey , moby dick now lay at a little 
distance , UNK thrusting his UNK white head up and down in the 
billows ; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole UNK body ; 
so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose - some twenty or more feet 
out of the water - the now rising swells , with all their UNK waves , 
UNK broke against it ; UNK tossing their shivered spray 
still higher into the air . * so , in a gale , the but half UNK UNK 
billows only UNK from the base of the UNK , UNK to 
UNK its summit with their scud . 
* this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale . it receives its UNK 
( pitchpoling ) from its being likened to that preliminary up - and - down 
UNK of the whale - lance , in the UNK called pitchpoling , previously 
described . by this motion the whale must best and most UNK 
view whatever objects may be UNK him . 
but soon resuming his horizontal attitude , moby dick swam swiftly round 
and round the wrecked crew ; sideways churning the water in his vengeful 
wake , as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault . 
the sight of the splintered boat seemed to UNK him , as the blood of 
grapes and UNK cast before UNK ' s elephants in the book 
of UNK . meanwhile ahab half UNK in the foam of the whale ' s 
UNK tail , and too much of a cripple to swim , - though he could still 
keep afloat , even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that ; UNK 
ahab ' s head was seen , like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock 
might burst . from the boat ' s UNK stern , fedallah UNK and 
mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other UNK end , could not 
succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves . 
for so UNK appalling was the white whale ' s aspect , and so 
UNK swift the ever - contracting circles he made , that he seemed 
horizontally UNK upon them . and though the other boats , unharmed , 
still hovered hard by ; still they dared not pull into the UNK to 
strike , lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of 
the UNK UNK , ahab and all ; nor in that case could they 
themselves hope to escape . with straining eyes , then , they remained on 
the outer edge of the direful zone , whose centre had now become the old 
man ' s head . 
meantime , from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship ' s 
mast heads ; and squaring her yards , she had borne down upon the scene ; 
and was now so nigh , that ahab in the water hailed her ! - " sail on 
the " - but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick , and 
whelmed him for the time . but struggling out of it again , and chancing 
to rise on a towering UNK , he shouted , - " sail on the whale ! - drive him 
off ! " 
the pequod ' s UNK were pointed ; and breaking up the charmed circle , she 
effectually parted the white whale from his UNK . as he sullenly swam 
off , the boats flew to the rescue . 
dragged into stubb ' s boat with blood - shot , UNK eyes , the white brine 
UNK in his wrinkles ; the long tension of ahab ' s bodily strength did 
crack , and helplessly he UNK to his body ' s doom : for a time , lying 
all crushed in the bottom of stubb ' s boat , like one UNK under foot 
of herds of elephants . far inland , nameless UNK came from him , as 
desolate sounds from out UNK . 
but this intensity of his physical UNK did but so much the more 
UNK it . in an instant ' s compass , great hearts sometimes UNK 
to one deep UNK , the sum UNK of those shallow pains kindly UNK 
through UNK men ' s whole lives . and so , such hearts , though summary 
in each one suffering ; still , if the gods UNK it , in their 
life - time aggregate a whole age of woe , wholly made up of instantaneous 
UNK ; for even in their UNK UNK , those noble UNK 
contain the entire UNK of inferior souls . 
" the harpoon , " said ahab , half way rising , and UNK leaning on one 
UNK arm - " is it safe ? " 
" aye , sir , for it was not darted ; this is it , " said stubb , showing it . 
" lay it before me ; - any missing men ? " 
" one , two , three , four , five ; - there were five oars , sir , and here are 
five men . " 
" that ' s good . - help me , man ; i wish to stand . so , so , i see him ! there ! 
there ! going to leeward still ; what a leaping spout ! - hands off from me ! 
the eternal sap runs up in ahab ' s bones again ! set the sail ; out oars ; 
the helm ! " 
it is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked 
up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus 
continued with what is called double - UNK oars . it was thus now . but 
the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale , 
for he seemed to have UNK - UNK his every fin ; swimming with a 
velocity which plainly showed , that if now , under these circumstances , 
pushed on , the chase would prove an UNK prolonged , if not a 
hopeless one ; nor could any crew endure for so long a period , such an 
UNK , intense straining at the oar ; a thing UNK tolerable 
only in some one brief UNK . the ship itself , then , as it 
sometimes happens , offered the most promising intermediate means of 
UNK the chase . accordingly , the boats now made for her , and were 
soon swayed up to their cranes - the two parts of the wrecked boat having 
been previously secured by her - and then hoisting everything to her 
side , and UNK her canvas high up , and sideways UNK it 
with stun - sails , like the double - UNK wings of an albatross ; the 
pequod bore down in the leeward wake of moby - dick . at the well known , 
UNK intervals , the whale ' s glittering spout was regularly announced 
from the manned mast - heads ; and when he would be reported as just gone 
down , ahab would take the time , and then pacing the deck , binnacle - watch 
in hand , so soon as the last second of the UNK hour UNK , his 
voice was heard . - " whose is the doubloon now ? d ' ye see him ? " and if the 
reply was , no , sir ! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his 
perch . in this way the day wore on ; ahab , now aloft and motionless ; 
anon , unrestingly pacing the planks . 
as he was thus walking , UNK no sound , except to hail the men aloft , 
or to bid them hoist a sail still higher , or to spread one to a still 
greater breadth - thus to and fro pacing , beneath his slouched hat , at 
every turn he passed his own wrecked boat , which had been dropped upon 
the quarter - deck , and lay there UNK ; broken bow to shattered stern . 
at last he paused before it ; and as in an already over - UNK sky fresh 
UNK of clouds will sometimes sail across , so over the old man ' s face 
there now stole some such added gloom as this . 
stubb saw him pause ; and perhaps UNK , not vainly , though , to 
evince his own unabated fortitude , and thus keep up a valiant place in 
his captain ' s mind , he advanced , and eyeing the wreck exclaimed - " the 
UNK the UNK refused ; it UNK his mouth too UNK , sir ; ha ! ha ! " 
" what UNK thing is this that laughs before a wreck ? man , man ! did 
i not know thee brave as fearless fire ( and as mechanical ) i could swear 
thou UNK a UNK . UNK nor laugh should be heard before a wreck . " 
" aye , sir , " said starbuck drawing near , " ' tis a solemn sight ; an UNK , 
and an ill one . " 
" UNK ? UNK ? - the UNK ! if the gods think to speak UNK to 
man , they will UNK speak UNK ; not shake their heads , and 
give an old wives ' UNK hint . - begone ! ye two are the opposite poles 
of one thing ; starbuck is stubb UNK , and stubb is starbuck ; and 
ye two are all mankind ; and ahab stands alone among the millions of 
the UNK earth , nor gods nor men his UNK ! cold , cold - i 
shiver ! - how now ? aloft there ! d ' ye see him ? sing out for every spout , 
though he spout ten times a second ! " 
the day was nearly done ; only the hem of his golden UNK was UNK . 
soon , it was almost dark , but the look - out men still remained UNK . 
" can ' t see the spout now , sir ; - too dark " - cried a voice from the air . 
" how heading when last seen ? " 
" as before , sir , - straight to leeward . " 
" good ! he will travel UNK now ' tis night . down UNK and top - gallant 
stun - sails , mr . starbuck . we must not run over him before morning ; he ' s 
making a passage now , and may heave - to a while . helm there ! keep her 
full before the wind ! - aloft ! come down ! - mr . stubb , send a fresh hand 
to the fore - mast head , and see it manned till morning . " - then advancing 
towards the doubloon in the main - mast - " men , this gold is mine , for i 
earned it ; but i shall let it UNK here till the white whale is dead ; 
and then , whosoever of ye first raises him , upon the day he shall be 
killed , this gold is that man ' s ; and if on that day i shall again raise 
him , then , ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye ! away 
now ! - the deck is thine , sir ! " 
and so saying , he placed himself half way within the scuttle , and 
UNK his hat , stood there till dawn , except when at intervals 
UNK himself to see how the night wore on . 
chapter UNK . the chase - second day . 
at day - break , the three mast - heads were UNK manned afresh . 
" d ' ye see him ? " cried ahab after UNK a little space for the light 
to spread . 
" see nothing , sir . " 
" turn up all hands and make sail ! he UNK UNK than i thought 
for ; - the top - gallant sails ! - aye , they should have been kept on her all 
night . but no matter - ' tis but resting for the rush . " 
here be it said , that this UNK pursuit of one particular whale , 
continued through day into night , and through night into day , is a thing 
by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery . for such is the 
wonderful skill , UNK of experience , and UNK confidence 
UNK by some great natural UNK among the nantucket commanders ; 
that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried , they 
will , under certain given circumstances , pretty UNK UNK both 
the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time , while out of 
sight , as well as his probable rate of UNK during that period . 
and , in these cases , somewhat as a pilot , when about losing sight of 
a coast , whose general UNK he well knows , and which he desires 
shortly to return to again , but at some further point ; like as this 
pilot stands by his compass , and takes the precise bearing of the 
cape at present visible , in order the more certainly to hit aright 
the remote , unseen UNK , eventually to be visited : so does the 
fisherman , at his compass , with the whale ; for after being chased , and 
diligently marked , through several hours of daylight , then , when night 
UNK the fish , the creature ' s future wake through the darkness 
is almost as UNK to the sagacious mind of the hunter , as the 
pilot ' s coast is to him . so that to this hunter ' s wondrous skill , the 
UNK UNK of a thing UNK in water , a wake , is to all 
desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the UNK land . and as the 
mighty iron leviathan of the modern UNK is so familiarly known in 
its every pace , that , with watches in their hands , men time his rate as 
doctors that of a baby ' s pulse ; and lightly say of it , the up train or 
the down train will reach such or such a spot , at such or such an hour ; 
even so , almost , there are occasions when these nantucketers time that 
other leviathan of the deep , according to the observed humor of his 
speed ; and say to themselves , so many hours hence this whale will have 
gone two hundred miles , will have about reached this or that degree of 
latitude or longitude . but to render this UNK at all successful in 
the end , the wind and the sea must be the whaleman ' s allies ; for of what 
present UNK to the becalmed or UNK mariner is the skill that 
UNK him he is exactly ninety - three leagues and a quarter from his 
port ? UNK from these statements , are many collateral subtile 
matters touching the chase of whales . 
the ship tore on ; leaving such a UNK in the sea as when a 
cannon - ball , UNK , becomes a UNK - share and turns up the level 
field . 
" by salt and hemp ! " cried stubb , " but this swift motion of the deck 
UNK up one ' s legs and UNK at the heart . this ship and i are two 
brave fellows ! - ha , ha ! some one take me up , and UNK me , spine - wise , 
on the sea , - for by live - UNK ! my spine ' s a keel . ha , ha ! we go the UNK 
that leaves no dust behind ! " 
" there she blows - she blows ! - she blows ! - right ahead ! " was now the 
mast - head cry . 
" aye , aye ! " cried stubb , " i knew it - ye can ' t escape - blow on and 
split your spout , o whale ! the mad fiend himself is after ye ! blow your 
trump - UNK your lungs ! - ahab will dam off your blood , as a UNK 
UNK his UNK upon the stream ! " 
and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew . the UNK 
of the chase had by this time worked them UNK up , like old wine 
worked anew . whatever pale fears and UNK some of them might 
have felt before ; these were not only now kept out of sight through the 
growing awe of ahab , but they were broken up , and on all sides UNK , 
as timid prairie UNK that UNK before the UNK UNK . the hand 
of fate had snatched all their souls ; and by the stirring perils of 
the previous day ; the rack of the past night ' s UNK ; the fixed , 
UNK , blind , reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging 
towards its flying mark ; by all these things , their hearts were UNK 
along . the wind that made great bellies of their sails , and rushed the 
vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible ; this seemed the symbol of 
that unseen UNK which so UNK them to the race . 
they were one man , not thirty . for as the one ship that held them all ; 
though it was put together of all contrasting things - oak , and UNK , 
and pine wood ; iron , and pitch , and hemp - yet all these ran into each 
other in the one UNK hull , which shot on its way , both balanced and 
directed by the long central keel ; even so , all the UNK of 
the crew , this man ' s UNK , that man ' s fear ; UNK and UNK , all 
varieties were welded into UNK , and were all directed to that fatal 
UNK which ahab their one lord and keel did point to . 
the rigging lived . the mast - heads , like the tops of tall palms , were 
UNK tufted with arms and legs . clinging to a spar with one 
hand , some reached forth the other with impatient UNK ; others , 
UNK their eyes from the vivid sunlight , sat far out on the rocking 
yards ; all the spars in full bearing of mortals , ready and ripe for 
their fate . ah ! how they still UNK through that infinite UNK to 
seek out the thing that might destroy them ! 
" why sing ye not out for him , if ye see him ? " cried ahab , when , after 
the UNK of some minutes since the first cry , no more had been heard . 
" sway me up , men ; ye have been UNK ; not moby dick casts one odd jet 
that way , and then disappears . " 
it was even so ; in their headlong eagerness , the men had mistaken some 
other thing for the whale - spout , as the event itself soon proved ; for 
hardly had ahab reached his perch ; hardly was the rope UNK to its 
pin on deck , when he struck the key - note to an UNK , that made the 
air UNK as with the combined UNK of UNK . the triumphant 
UNK of thirty buckskin lungs was heard , as - much nearer to the ship 
than the place of the UNK jet , less than a mile ahead - moby dick 
bodily burst into view ! for not by any calm and indolent spoutings ; not 
by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head , did the white 
whale now UNK his vicinity ; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon 
of UNK . rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths , 
the sperm whale thus UNK his entire bulk into the pure element of 
air , and UNK up a mountain of UNK foam , shows his place to the 
distance of seven miles and more . in those moments , the torn , enraged 
waves he shakes off , seem his UNK ; in some cases , this UNK is his 
act of defiance . 
" there she UNK ! there she UNK ! " was the cry , as in his 
UNK UNK the white whale tossed himself UNK - like to 
heaven . so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea , and relieved 
against the still UNK margin of the sky , the spray that he raised , for 
the moment , intolerably UNK and glared like a UNK ; and 
stood there gradually UNK and UNK away from its first sparkling 
intensity , to the dim UNK of an advancing shower in a vale . 
" aye , breach your last to the sun , moby dick ! " cried ahab , " thy hour and 
thy harpoon are at hand ! - down ! down all of ye , but one man at the fore . 
the boats ! - stand by ! " 
unmindful of the UNK rope - UNK of the shrouds , the men , like 
shooting stars , slid to the deck , by the isolated UNK and 
halyards ; while ahab , less UNK , but still rapidly was dropped from 
his perch . 
" lower away , " he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat - a spare one , 
rigged the afternoon previous . " mr . starbuck , the ship is thine - keep 
away from the boats , but keep near them . lower , all ! " 
as if to strike a quick terror into them , by this time being the first 
UNK himself , moby dick had turned , and was now coming for the 
three crews . ahab ' s boat was central ; and cheering his men , he told them 
he would take the whale head - and - head , - that is , pull straight up to his 
forehead , - a not uncommon thing ; for when within a certain limit , such 
a course UNK the coming onset from the whale ' s sidelong vision . 
but ere that close limit was gained , and while yet all three boats were 
plain as the ship ' s three masts to his eye ; the white whale churning 
himself into furious speed , almost in an instant as it were , rushing 
among the boats with open jaws , and a lashing tail , offered appalling 
battle on every side ; and UNK of the irons darted at him from every 
boat , seemed only intent on UNK each separate plank of which 
those boats were made . but UNK UNK , incessantly UNK 
like UNK UNK in the field ; the boats for a while eluded him ; 
though , at times , but by a plank ' s breadth ; while all the time , ahab ' s 
unearthly UNK tore every other cry but his to shreds . 
but at last in his UNK UNK , the white whale so crossed 
and UNK , and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three 
lines now fast to him , that they UNK , and , of themselves , 
UNK the UNK boats towards the planted irons in him ; though now 
for a moment the whale drew aside a little , as if to UNK for a more 
tremendous charge . seizing that opportunity , ahab first paid out more 
line : and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again - UNK 
that way to UNK it of some UNK - when lo ! - a sight more savage 
than the UNK teeth of sharks ! 
caught and twisted - UNK in the UNK of the line , loose harpoons 
and lances , with all their UNK barbs and points , came flashing 
and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahab ' s boat . only one 
thing could be done . seizing the boat - knife , he UNK reached 
within - through - and then , without - the rays of steel ; dragged in 
the line beyond , passed it , UNK , to the bowsman , and then , twice 
UNK the rope near the chocks - dropped the UNK UNK of 
steel into the sea ; and was all fast again . that instant , the white 
whale made a sudden rush among the remaining UNK of the other lines ; 
by so doing , UNK dragged the more involved boats of stubb and 
flask towards his flukes ; dashed them together like two rolling UNK on 
a surf - beaten beach , and then , diving down into the sea , disappeared in 
a boiling maelstrom , in which , for a space , the odorous cedar chips of 
the wrecks UNK round and round , like the UNK UNK in a swiftly 
stirred bowl of punch . 
while the two crews were yet UNK in the waters , reaching out after 
the revolving line - tubs , oars , and other floating furniture , while 
UNK little flask UNK up and down like an empty vial , UNK his 
legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks ; and stubb was UNK 
singing out for some one to UNK him up ; and while the old man ' s 
line - now UNK - admitted of his pulling into the creamy UNK to 
rescue whom he could ; - in that wild UNK of a thousand 
UNK perils , - ahab ' s yet UNK boat seemed drawn up towards 
heaven by invisible UNK , - as , arrow - like , shooting perpendicularly 
from the sea , the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its 
bottom , and sent it , turning over and over , into the air ; till it fell 
again - gunwale downwards - and ahab and his men UNK out from under 
it , like seals from a sea - side cave . 
the first uprising UNK of the whale - UNK its direction as 
he struck the surface - involuntarily launched him along it , to a little 
distance from the centre of the destruction he had made ; and with his 
back to it , he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from 
side to side ; and whenever a UNK oar , bit of plank , the least chip 
or UNK of the boats touched his skin , his tail swiftly drew back , and 
came sideways UNK the sea . but soon , as if satisfied that his work 
for that time was done , he pushed his UNK forehead through the 
ocean , and UNK after him the UNK lines , continued his 
leeward way at a traveller ' s UNK pace . 
as before , the UNK ship having descried the whole fight , again 
came bearing down to the rescue , and dropping a boat , picked up the 
floating mariners , tubs , oars , and whatever else could be caught at , and 
safely landed them on her decks . some sprained shoulders , wrists , and 
UNK ; UNK UNK ; wrenched harpoons and lances ; UNK 
intricacies of rope ; shattered oars and planks ; all these were there ; 
but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one . as 
with fedallah the day before , so ahab was now found grimly clinging to 
his boat ' s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor 
did it so UNK him as the previous day ' s mishap . 
but when he was helped to the deck , all eyes were fastened upon him ; as 
instead of standing by himself he still half - hung upon the shoulder of 
starbuck , who had thus far been the foremost to assist him . his ivory 
leg had been snapped off , leaving but one short sharp UNK . 
" aye , aye , starbuck , ' tis sweet to lean sometimes , be the UNK who he 
will ; and would old ahab had leaned oftener than he has . " 
" the UNK has not stood , sir , " said the carpenter , now coming up ; " i 
put good work into that leg . " 
" but no bones broken , sir , i hope , " said stubb with true concern . 
" aye ! and all splintered to pieces , stubb ! - d ' ye see it . - but even with 
a broken bone , old ahab is UNK ; and i account no living bone of 
mine one jot more me , than this dead one that ' s lost . nor white whale , 
nor man , nor fiend , can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and 
UNK being . can any lead touch yonder floor , any mast scrape 
yonder roof ? - aloft there ! which way ? " 
" dead to leeward , sir . " 
" up helm , then ; pile on the sail again , ship keepers ! down the rest of 
the spare boats and rig them - mr . starbuck away , and UNK the boat ' s 
crews . " 
" let me first help thee towards the bulwarks , sir . " 
" oh , oh , oh ! how this UNK UNK me now ! accursed fate ! that the 
unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate ! " 
" sir ? " 
" my body , man , not thee . give me something for a cane - there , that 
shivered lance will do . UNK the men . surely i have not seen him yet . 
by heaven it cannot be ! - missing ? - quick ! call them all . " 
the old man ' s hinted thought was true . upon mustering the company , the 
parsee was not there . 
" the parsee ! " cried stubb - " he must have been caught in - " 
" the black UNK UNK thee ! - run all of ye above , UNK , cabin , 
forecastle - find him - not gone - not gone ! " 
but quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the parsee was 
nowhere to be found . 
" aye , sir , " said stubb - " caught among the UNK of your line - i 
thought i saw him dragging under . " 
" my line ! my line ? gone ? - gone ? what means that little word ? - what 
death - UNK rings in it , that old ahab shakes as if he were the UNK . 
the harpoon , too ! - toss over the UNK there , - d ' ye see it ? - the forged 
iron , men , the white whale ' s - no , no , no , - UNK fool ! this hand did 
dart it ! - ' tis in the fish ! - aloft there ! keep him nailed - quick ! - all 
hands to the rigging of the boats - UNK the oars - harpooneers ! 
the irons , the irons ! - hoist the UNK higher - a pull on all the 
sheets ! - helm there ! steady , steady for your life ! i ' ll ten times girdle 
the UNK globe ; yea and dive straight through it , but i ' ll UNK 
him yet ! " 
" great god ! but for one single instant show thyself , " cried starbuck ; 
" never , never wilt thou capture him , old man - in UNK ' name no more of 
this , that ' s worse than devil ' s madness . two days chased ; twice stove 
to splinters ; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee ; thy evil 
shadow gone - all good angels UNK thee with warnings : - 
" what more UNK thou have ? - shall we keep chasing this murderous fish 
till he UNK the last man ? shall we be dragged by him to the bottom 
of the sea ? shall we be towed by him to the infernal world ? oh , 
oh , - UNK and UNK to hunt him more ! " 
" starbuck , of late i ' ve felt strangely moved to thee ; ever since that 
hour we both saw - thou know ' st what , in one another ' s eyes . but in this 
matter of the whale , be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this 
hand - a UNK , UNK blank . ahab is for ever ahab , man . this 
whole act ' s UNK UNK . ' twas UNK by thee and me a UNK 
years before this ocean rolled . fool ! i am the fates ' UNK ; i act 
under orders . look thou , UNK ! that thou UNK mine . - stand round 
me , men . ye see an old man cut down to the stump ; leaning on a shivered 
lance ; UNK up on a lonely foot . ' tis ahab - his body ' s part ; but 
ahab ' s soul ' s a UNK , that moves upon a hundred legs . i feel 
strained , half stranded , as ropes that tow dismasted UNK in a gale ; 
and i may look so . but ere i break , ye ' ll hear me crack ; and till ye hear 
that , know that ahab ' s UNK UNK his purpose yet . believe ye , men , in 
the things called UNK ? then laugh UNK , and cry UNK ! for ere they 
drown , drowning things will twice rise to the surface ; then rise again , 
to sink for evermore . so with moby dick - two days he ' s floated - UNK 
will be the third . aye , men , he ' ll rise once more , - but only to spout 
his last ! d ' ye feel brave men , brave ? " 
" as fearless fire , " cried stubb . 
" and as mechanical , " muttered ahab . then as the men went forward , he 
muttered on : " the things called UNK ! and yesterday i talked the same 
to starbuck there , concerning my broken boat . oh ! how UNK i seek 
to drive out of others ' hearts what ' s UNK so fast in mine ! - the 
parsee - the parsee ! - gone , gone ? and he was to go before : - but still was 
to be seen again ere i could perish - how ' s that ? - there ' s a riddle now 
might UNK all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line 
of UNK : - like a UNK ' s UNK it UNK my brain . i ' ll , i ' ll solve it , 
though ! " 
when UNK descended , the whale was still in sight to leeward . 
so once more the sail was UNK , and everything passed nearly as 
on the previous night ; only , the sound of hammers , and the hum of the 
UNK was heard till nearly daylight , as the men toiled by lanterns 
in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and UNK 
their fresh weapons for the morrow . meantime , of the broken keel of 
ahab ' s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg ; while still as 
on the night before , slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle ; his 
UNK , UNK glance UNK gone backward on its dial ; sat due 
eastward for the UNK sun . 
chapter UNK . the chase . - third day . 
the morning of the third day UNK fair and fresh , and once more the 
solitary night - man at the fore - mast - head was relieved by crowds of the 
daylight look - outs , who dotted every mast and almost every spar . 
" d ' ye see him ? " cried ahab ; but the whale was not yet in sight . 
" in his infallible wake , though ; but follow that wake , that ' s all . helm 
there ; steady , as thou UNK , and hast been going . what a lovely day 
again ! were it a new - made world , and made for a summer - house to the 
angels , and this morning the first of its throwing open to them , a 
UNK day could not dawn upon that world . here ' s food for thought , had 
ahab time to think ; but ahab never thinks ; he only feels , feels , feels ; 
that ' s UNK enough for mortal man ! to think ' s UNK . god only has 
that right and privilege . thinking is , or ought to be , a UNK and a 
UNK ; and our poor hearts UNK , and our poor brains beat too much 
for that . and yet , i ' ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm - frozen 
calm , this old skull cracks so , like a glass in which the contents 
turned to ice , and shiver it . and still this hair is growing now ; this 
moment growing , and heat must breed it ; but no , it ' s like that sort 
of common grass that will grow anywhere , between the UNK UNK of 
greenland ice or in UNK UNK . how the wild winds blow it ; they whip 
it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they 
UNK to . a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through UNK 
UNK and cells , and UNK of UNK , and UNK them , and 
now comes blowing hither as innocent as UNK . out upon it ! - it ' s 
UNK . were i the wind , i ' d blow no more on such a wicked , miserable 
world . i ' d crawl somewhere to a cave , and UNK there . and yet , ' tis a 
noble and UNK thing , the wind ! who ever UNK it ? in every fight 
it has the last and bitterest blow . run UNK at it , and you but run 
through it . ha ! a coward wind that strikes stark naked men , but will not 
stand to receive a single blow . even ahab is a UNK thing - a nobler 
thing than that . would now the wind but had a body ; but all the things 
that most UNK and UNK mortal man , all these things are 
UNK , but only UNK as objects , not as UNK . there ' s a most 
special , a most cunning , oh , a most malicious difference ! and yet , i 
say again , and swear it now , that there ' s something all glorious and 
gracious in the wind . these warm UNK winds , at least , that in the 
clear heavens blow straight on , in strong and UNK , vigorous 
mildness ; and UNK not from their mark , however the UNK currents of 
the sea may turn and UNK , and mightiest UNK of the land swift 
and swerve about , uncertain where to go at last . and by the eternal 
poles ! these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on ; these 
trades , or something like them - something so UNK , and full as 
strong , blow my UNK soul along ! to it ! aloft there ! what d ' ye see ? " 
" nothing , sir . " 
" nothing ! and noon at hand ! the doubloon goes a - begging ! see the sun ! 
aye , aye , it must be so . i ' ve UNK him . how , got the start ? aye , 
he ' s chasing me now ; not i , him - that ' s bad ; i might have known it , too . 
fool ! the lines - the harpoons he ' s towing . aye , aye , i have run him by 
last night . about ! about ! come down , all of ye , but the regular look 
outs ! man the braces ! " 
steering as she had done , the wind had been somewhat on the pequod ' s 
quarter , so that now being pointed in the UNK direction , the UNK 
ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she UNK the cream in her own 
white wake . 
" against the wind he now UNK for the open jaw , " murmured starbuck to 
himself , as he coiled the new - hauled main - brace upon the rail . " god keep 
us , but already my bones feel damp within me , and from the inside wet my 
flesh . i UNK me that i UNK my god in obeying him ! " 
" stand by to sway me up ! " cried ahab , advancing to the hempen basket . 
" we should meet him soon . " 
" aye , aye , sir , " and straightway starbuck did ahab ' s bidding , and once 
more ahab swung on high . 
a whole hour now passed ; gold - beaten out to ages . time itself now held 
long breaths with keen UNK . but at last , some three points off the 
weather bow , ahab descried the spout again , and instantly from the three 
mast - heads three shrieks went up as if the UNK of fire had UNK 
it . 
" forehead to forehead i meet thee , this third time , moby dick ! on deck 
there ! - brace sharper up ; crowd her into the wind ' s eye . he ' s too 
far off to lower yet , mr . starbuck . the sails shake ! stand over that 
helmsman with a top - maul ! so , so ; he UNK fast , and i must down . but 
let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea ; there ' s 
time for that . an old , old sight , and yet somehow so young ; aye , and 
not changed a UNK since i first saw it , a boy , from the sand - hills of 
nantucket ! the same ! - the same ! - the same to noah as to me . there ' s 
a soft shower to leeward . such lovely UNK ! they must lead 
somewhere - to something else than common land , more UNK than the 
palms . leeward ! the white whale goes that way ; look to windward , 
then ; the better if the UNK quarter . but good bye , good bye , old 
mast - head ! what ' s this ? - green ? aye , UNK mosses in these UNK cracks . 
no such green weather UNK on ahab ' s head ! there ' s the difference now 
between man ' s old age and matter ' s . but aye , old mast , we both grow old 
together ; sound in our hulls , though , are we not , my ship ? aye , UNK 
a leg , that ' s all . by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live 
flesh every way . i can ' t compare with it ; and i ' ve known some ships made 
of dead trees UNK the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of 
vital fathers . what ' s that he said ? he should still go before me , my 
pilot ; and yet to be seen again ? but where ? will i have eyes at the 
bottom of the sea , supposing i descend those endless stairs ? and all 
night i ' ve been sailing from him , wherever he did sink to . aye , aye , 
like many more thou told ' st direful truth as touching thyself , o parsee ; 
but , ahab , there thy shot fell short . good - bye , mast - head - keep a good 
eye upon the whale , the while i ' m gone . we ' ll talk to - morrow , nay , 
to - night , when the white whale lies down there , tied by head and tail . " 
he gave the word ; and still gazing round him , was steadily lowered 
through the UNK blue air to the deck . 
in due time the boats were lowered ; but as standing in his UNK ' s 
stern , ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent , he waved to the 
mate , - who held one of the tackle - ropes on deck - and bade him pause . 
" starbuck ! " 
" sir ? " 
" for the third time my soul ' s ship starts upon this voyage , starbuck . " 
" aye , sir , thou wilt have it so . " 
" some ships sail from their ports , and ever afterwards are missing , 
starbuck ! " 
" truth , sir : saddest truth . " 
" some men die at UNK tide ; some at low water ; some at the full of 
the flood ; - and i feel now like a billow that ' s all one UNK UNK , 
starbuck . i am old ; - shake hands with me , man . " 
their hands met ; their eyes fastened ; starbuck ' s UNK the UNK . 
" oh , my captain , my captain ! - noble heart - go not - go not ! - see , it ' s a 
brave man that UNK ; how great the agony of the UNK then ! " 
" lower away ! " - cried ahab , tossing the mate ' s arm from him . " stand by 
the crew ! " 
in an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern . 
" the sharks ! the sharks ! " cried a voice from the low cabin - window there ; 
" o master , my master , come back ! " 
but ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was high - lifted then ; and the 
boat leaped on . 
yet the voice spake true ; for scarce had he pushed from the ship , when 
numbers of sharks , seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath 
the hull , UNK snapped at the blades of the oars , every time they 
dipped in the water ; and in this way accompanied the boat with their 
UNK . it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale - boats in 
those swarming seas ; the sharks at times apparently following them in 
the same UNK way that UNK UNK over the UNK of marching 
UNK in the east . but these were the first sharks that had been 
observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried ; 
and whether it was that ahab ' s crew were all such tiger - yellow 
UNK , and therefore their flesh more musky to the UNK of the 
sharks - a matter sometimes well known to affect them , - however it was , 
they seemed to follow that one boat without UNK the others . 
" heart of wrought steel ! " murmured starbuck gazing over the side , and 
following with his eyes the UNK boat - " canst thou yet ring boldly 
to that sight ? - lowering thy keel among UNK sharks , and followed by 
them , open - mouthed to the chase ; and this the critical third day ? - for 
when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit ; be sure 
the first is the morning , the second the noon , and the third the evening 
and the end of that thing - be that end what it may . oh ! my god ! what 
is this that shoots through me , and leaves me so deadly calm , yet 
UNK , - fixed at the top of a shudder ! future things swim before me , 
as in empty UNK and skeletons ; all the past is somehow grown dim . 
mary , girl ! thou UNK in pale glories behind me ; boy ! i seem to 
see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue . strangest UNK of life seem 
clearing ; but clouds sweep between - is my UNK ' s end coming ? my legs 
feel faint ; like his who has footed it all day . feel thy heart , - UNK 
it yet ? stir thyself , starbuck ! - stave it off - move , move ! 
speak UNK ! - mast - head there ! see ye my boy ' s hand on the 
hill ? - crazed ; - aloft there ! - keep thy UNK eye upon the boats : - 
" mark well the whale ! - ho ! again ! - drive off that UNK ! see ! he UNK - he 
UNK the UNK " - pointing to the red flag flying at the main - truck - " ha ! 
he UNK away with it ! - where ' s the old man now ? see ' st thou that sight , 
oh ahab ! - shudder , shudder ! " 
the boats had not gone very far , when by a signal from the mast - heads - a 
downward pointed arm , ahab knew that the whale had sounded ; but 
UNK to be near him at the next rising , he held on his way a little 
sideways from the vessel ; the UNK crew UNK the profoundest 
silence , as the head - beat waves hammered and hammered against the 
opposing bow . 
" drive , drive in your nails , oh ye waves ! to their uttermost heads 
drive them in ! ye but strike a thing without a lid ; and no coffin and no 
hearse can be mine : - and hemp only can kill me ! ha ! ha ! " 
suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles ; then 
quickly UNK , as if sideways sliding from a submerged UNK of 
ice , swiftly rising to the surface . a low UNK sound was heard ; a 
subterraneous hum ; and then all held their breaths ; as UNK with 
UNK ropes , and harpoons , and lances , a vast form shot lengthwise , 
but obliquely from the sea . shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist , it 
hovered for a moment in the UNK air ; and then fell UNK back 
into the deep . crushed thirty feet upwards , the waters UNK for 
an instant like heaps of fountains , then UNK sank in a shower of 
UNK , leaving the UNK surface UNK like new milk round the 
marble trunk of the whale . 
" give way ! " cried ahab to the oarsmen , and the boats darted forward to 
the attack ; but maddened by yesterday ' s fresh irons that UNK in 
him , moby dick seemed UNK possessed by all the angels that fell 
from heaven . the wide UNK of welded tendons UNK his broad 
white forehead , beneath the transparent skin , looked UNK together ; 
as head on , he came churning his tail among the boats ; and once more 
UNK them apart ; UNK out the irons and lances from the two 
mates ' boats , and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows , 
but leaving ahab ' s almost without a scar . 
while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks ; and as the 
whale swimming out from them , turned , and showed one entire flank as he 
shot by them again ; at that moment a quick cry went up . lashed round 
and round to the fish ' s back ; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which , 
during the past night , the whale had reeled the UNK of the lines 
around him , the half torn body of the parsee was seen ; his sable UNK 
UNK to shreds ; his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab . 
the harpoon dropped from his hand . 
" UNK , UNK ! " - drawing in a long lean breath - " aye , parsee ! i 
see thee again . - aye , and thou UNK before ; and this , this then is the 
hearse that thou didst promise . but i hold thee to the last letter of 
thy word . where is the second hearse ? away , mates , to the ship ! those 
boats are useless now ; UNK them if ye can in time , and return to 
me ; if not , ahab is enough to die - down , men ! the first thing that but 
offers to jump from this boat i stand in , that thing i harpoon . ye are 
not other men , but my arms and my legs ; and so obey me . - where ' s the 
whale ? gone down again ? " 
but he looked too nigh the boat ; for as if bent upon escaping with the 
corpse he bore , and as if the particular place of the last encounter had 
been but a stage in his leeward voyage , moby dick was now again steadily 
swimming forward ; and had almost passed the ship , - which thus far had 
been sailing in the contrary direction to him , though for the present 
her headway had been stopped . he seemed swimming with his utmost 
velocity , and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the 
sea . 
" oh ! ahab , " cried starbuck , " not too late is it , even now , the third 
day , to desist . see ! moby dick seeks thee not . it is thou , thou , that 
madly UNK him ! " 
setting sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to 
leeward , by both oars and canvas . and at last when ahab was sliding 
by the vessel , so near as plainly to distinguish starbuck ' s face as he 
leaned over the rail , he hailed him to turn the vessel about , and follow 
him , not too swiftly , at a UNK interval . glancing upwards , he 
saw tashtego , queequeg , and daggoo , eagerly UNK to the three 
mast - heads ; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two UNK boats 
which had but just been hoisted to the side , and were UNK at work in 
UNK them . one after the other , through the port - holes , as he UNK , 
he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask , UNK themselves 
on deck among UNK of new irons and lances . as he saw all this ; as he 
heard the hammers in the broken boats ; far other hammers seemed driving 
a nail into his heart . but he rallied . and now marking that the UNK or 
flag was gone from the main - mast - head , he shouted to tashtego , who had 
just gained that perch , to descend again for another flag , and a hammer 
and nails , and so nail it to the mast . 
whether UNK by the three days ' running chase , and the resistance 
to his swimming in the knotted UNK he bore ; or whether it was some 
latent UNK and malice in him : UNK was true , the white 
whale ' s way now began to UNK , as it seemed , from the boat so rapidly 
UNK him once more ; though indeed the whale ' s last start had not been 
so long a one as before . and still as ahab glided over the waves the 
UNK sharks accompanied him ; and so UNK stuck to the 
boat ; and so continually bit at the UNK oars , that the blades became 
UNK and UNK , and left small splinters in the sea , at almost 
every dip . 
" heed them not ! those teeth but give new UNK to your oars . pull on ! 
' tis the better rest , the shark ' s jaw than the yielding water . " 
" but at every bite , sir , the thin blades grow smaller and smaller ! " 
" they will last long enough ! pull on ! - but who can tell " - he 
muttered - " whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on 
ahab ? - but pull on ! aye , all alive , now - we near him . the helm ! take the 
helm ! let me pass , " - and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward 
to the bows of the still flying boat . 
at length as the craft was cast to one side , and ran ranging along 
with the white whale ' s flank , he seemed strangely UNK of its 
advance - as the whale sometimes will - and ahab was fairly within the 
smoky mountain mist , which , thrown off from the whale ' s spout , curled 
round his great , UNK hump ; he was even thus close to him ; when , 
with body arched back , and both arms lengthwise high - lifted to the 
UNK , he darted his fierce iron , and his far UNK curse into the 
hated whale . as both steel and curse sank to the socket , as if sucked 
into a UNK , moby dick sideways UNK ; spasmodically rolled his nigh 
flank against the bow , and , without UNK a hole in it , so suddenly 
canted the boat over , that had it not been for the elevated part of the 
gunwale to which he then clung , ahab would once more have been tossed 
into the sea . as it was , three of the oarsmen - who UNK not the 
precise instant of the dart , and were therefore UNK for its 
UNK - these were flung out ; but so fell , that , in an instant two of 
them UNK the gunwale again , and rising to its level on a combing 
wave , hurled themselves bodily UNK again ; the third man helplessly 
dropping astern , but still afloat and swimming . 
almost simultaneously , with a mighty volition of UNK , 
instantaneous UNK , the white whale darted through the weltering 
sea . but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with 
the line , and hold it so ; and commanded the crew to turn round on their 
UNK , and tow the boat up to the mark ; the moment the treacherous line 
felt that double strain and UNK , it snapped in the empty air ! 
" what breaks in me ? some UNK cracks ! - ' tis whole again ; oars ! oars ! 
burst in upon him ! " 
hearing the tremendous rush of the sea - UNK boat , the whale wheeled 
round to present his blank forehead at bay ; but in that UNK , 
catching sight of the UNK black hull of the ship ; seemingly seeing 
in it the source of all his UNK ; bethinking it - it may be - a 
larger and nobler foe ; of a sudden , he bore down upon its advancing 
prow , UNK his jaws amid fiery showers of foam . 
ahab UNK ; his hand smote his forehead . " i grow blind ; hands ! 
stretch out before me that i may yet grope my way . is ' t night ? " 
" the whale ! the ship ! " cried the UNK oarsmen . 
" oars ! oars ! UNK downwards to thy depths , o sea , that ere it be for 
ever too late , ahab may slide this last , last time upon his mark ! i see : 
the ship ! the ship ! dash on , my men ! will ye not save my ship ? " 
but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the 
UNK - UNK seas , the before whale - smitten bow - ends of two planks 
burst through , and in an instant almost , the temporarily UNK boat 
lay nearly level with the waves ; its half - UNK , UNK crew , trying 
hard to stop the UNK and UNK out the UNK water . 
meantime , for that one beholding instant , tashtego ' s mast - head hammer 
remained suspended in his hand ; and the red flag , half - UNK him as 
with a UNK , then streamed itself straight out from him , as his own 
forward - flowing heart ; while starbuck and stubb , standing upon the 
bowsprit beneath , caught sight of the down - coming monster just as soon 
as he . 
" the whale , the whale ! up helm , up helm ! oh , all ye sweet powers of air , 
now hug me close ! let not starbuck die , if die he must , in a woman ' s 
UNK fit . up helm , i say - ye fools , the jaw ! the jaw ! is this the 
end of all my bursting prayers ? all my life - long UNK ? oh , ahab , 
ahab , lo , thy work . steady ! helmsman , steady . nay , nay ! up helm again ! 
he turns to meet us ! oh , his UNK brow drives on towards one , 
whose duty tells him he cannot depart . my god , stand by me now ! " 
" stand not by me , but stand under me , whoever you are that will now help 
stubb ; for stubb , too , sticks here . i grin at thee , thou grinning whale ! 
who ever helped stubb , or kept stubb awake , but stubb ' s own UNK 
eye ? and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a UNK that is all too 
soft ; would it were stuffed with UNK ! i grin at thee , thou 
grinning whale ! look ye , sun , moon , and stars ! i call ye UNK of 
as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost . for all that , i would yet 
ring glasses with ye , would ye but hand the cup ! oh , oh ! oh , oh ! thou 
grinning whale , but there ' ll be plenty of UNK soon ! why fly ye 
not , o ahab ! for me , off shoes and jacket to it ; let stubb die in 
his drawers ! a most mouldy and over salted death , though ; - UNK ! 
UNK ! UNK ! oh , flask , for one red UNK ere we die ! " 
" UNK ? i only wish that we were where they grow . oh , stubb , i hope 
my poor mother ' s drawn my part - pay ere this ; if not , few UNK will 
now come to her , for the voyage is up . " 
from the ship ' s bows , nearly all the seamen now hung UNK ; hammers , 
bits of plank , lances , and harpoons , mechanically retained in their 
hands , just as they had darted from their various UNK ; all their 
enchanted eyes intent upon the whale , which from side to side strangely 
vibrating his UNK head , sent a broad band of UNK 
semicircular foam before him as he rushed . retribution , swift vengeance , 
eternal malice were in his whole aspect , and spite of all that mortal 
man could do , the solid white UNK of his forehead smote the ship ' s 
starboard bow , till men and timbers reeled . some fell flat upon their 
faces . like UNK trucks , the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook 
on their bull - like necks . through the breach , they heard the waters 
pour , as mountain UNK down a UNK . 
" the ship ! the hearse ! - the second hearse ! " cried ahab from the boat ; 
" its wood could only be american ! " 
diving beneath the UNK ship , the whale ran UNK along its 
keel ; but turning under water , swiftly shot to the surface again , far 
off the other bow , but within a few yards of ahab ' s boat , where , for a 
time , he lay UNK . 
" i turn my body from the sun . what ho , tashtego ! let me hear thy hammer . 
oh ! ye three UNK spires of mine ; thou UNK keel ; and only 
god - UNK hull ; thou firm deck , and haughty helm , and pole - pointed 
prow , - death - glorious ship ! must ye then perish , and without me ? am i 
cut off from the last fond pride of meanest UNK captains ? oh , 
lonely death on lonely life ! oh , now i feel my topmost UNK lies in 
my topmost grief . ho , ho ! from all your furthest UNK , pour ye now in , 
ye bold billows of my whole UNK life , and top this one piled UNK 
of my death ! towards thee i roll , thou all - UNK but UNK 
whale ; to the last i UNK with thee ; from hell ' s heart i stab at 
thee ; for hate ' s sake i UNK my last breath at thee . sink all coffins 
and all UNK to one common UNK ! and since neither can be mine , let 
me then tow to pieces , while still chasing thee , though tied to thee , 
thou damned whale ! thus , i give up the spear ! " 
the harpoon was darted ; the stricken whale flew forward ; with UNK 
velocity the line ran through the grooves ; - ran foul . ahab stooped to 
clear it ; he did clear it ; but the flying turn caught him round the 
neck , and UNK as turkish UNK UNK their UNK , he was 
shot out of the boat , ere the crew knew he was gone . next instant , the 
heavy eye - splice in the rope ' s final end flew out of the stark - empty 
tub , knocked down an oarsman , and UNK the sea , disappeared in its 
depths . 
for an instant , the UNK boat ' s crew stood still ; then turned . " the 
ship ? great god , where is the ship ? " soon they through dim , UNK 
UNK saw her sidelong UNK phantom , as in the UNK UNK UNK ; 
only the uppermost masts out of water ; while fixed by UNK , or 
UNK , or fate , to their once lofty UNK , the pagan harpooneers 
still maintained their sinking UNK on the sea . and now , concentric 
circles seized the lone boat itself , and all its crew , and each floating 
oar , and every lance - pole , and spinning , UNK and UNK , all 
round and round in one UNK , carried the smallest chip of the pequod 
out of sight . 
but as the last UNK UNK poured themselves over the 
sunken head of the indian at the mainmast , leaving a few inches of the 
erect spar yet visible , together with long UNK yards of the flag , 
which calmly undulated , with UNK UNK , over the UNK 
billows they almost touched ; - at that instant , a red arm and a hammer 
hovered UNK uplifted in the open air , in the act of UNK 
the flag UNK and yet UNK to the UNK spar . a sky - UNK that 
UNK had followed the main - truck downwards from its natural home 
among the stars , UNK at the flag , and UNK tashtego there ; 
this bird now chanced to UNK its broad UNK wing between the 
hammer and the wood ; and simultaneously feeling that UNK UNK , 
the submerged savage beneath , in his death - gasp , kept his hammer frozen 
there ; and so the bird of heaven , with UNK shrieks , and his 
imperial UNK thrust upwards , and his whole captive form folded in the 
flag of ahab , went down with his ship , which , like satan , would not sink 
to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her , and 
UNK herself with it . 
now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf ; a sullen white 
surf beat against its steep sides ; then all collapsed , and the great 
shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago . 
" and i only am escaped alone to tell thee " job . 
the drama ' s done . why then here does any one step forth ? - because one 
did survive the wreck . 
it so chanced , that after the parsee ' s UNK , i was he whom the 
fates UNK to take the place of ahab ' s bowsman , when that bowsman 
assumed the vacant post ; the same , who , when on the last day the three 
men were tossed from out of the rocking boat , was dropped astern . so , 
floating on the margin of the ensuing scene , and in full sight of it , 
when the UNK UNK of the sunk ship reached me , i was then , 
but slowly , drawn towards the UNK UNK . when i reached it , it had 
subsided to a creamy UNK . round and round , then , and ever contracting 
towards the button - like black bubble at the axis of that slowly UNK 
circle , like another UNK i did revolve . till , gaining that vital 
centre , the black bubble upward burst ; and now , UNK by reason of 
its cunning spring , and , owing to its great buoyancy , rising with great 
force , the coffin life - UNK shot lengthwise from the sea , fell over , and 
floated by my side . buoyed up by that coffin , for almost one whole day 
and night , i floated on a soft and UNK main . the UNK sharks , 
they glided by as if with UNK on their mouths ; the savage sea - UNK 
sailed with UNK UNK . on the second day , a sail drew near , nearer , 
and picked me up at last . it was the UNK - cruising UNK , that in 
her UNK search after her missing children , only found another 
UNK .
